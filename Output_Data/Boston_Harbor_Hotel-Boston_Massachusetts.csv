101001694,89575,60745,"Hotel very nice.  Wine paring dinner, not so good","My son and daughter-in-law invited us to spend the a weekend with them in Boston and we jumped at the chance even though we had a late Friday night event and would have to drive up from NJ after 8PM.  We arrived at about 12:30AM to a quiet lobby.  When they staff saw us everything jumped into motion.  The valet was there in an instant.  The bell cap took our bags and we in our room in 10 mintues.  The staff was amazing.  The room was overlooking the harbor and since this was a wine/dinner package we got a nice room.  Evern with Logan in the background we could not hear any jet noise which was a pleasant surprise.  The barbor view was amazing as it always it whenever we get to Boston.  We ordered breakfast in the next morning, again fantastic.  We went down later in the day for Bloody Marys at the bar and they as well as the bartender were great.  Here is where it starts to go bad.  The Dinner which was supposed to be upscale but turned downward.  The service was not good even though everyone was friendly, at one point I had to ask a bus boy to remove our plates even though the station was right next to our table and we had finnished quite awhile ago.  The food was not hot when it arrived and the wine was not explained in any great detail or for that matter was not that good for a wine paring dinner package.  The table next to us must have known the manager since they at times had 4 people around a table of six and took a tour of the kitchen.  What I would say is stay at the hotel but eat in the North End.  It is much better and fuggettaboutit, better priced!",0,"March 21, 2011", March 2011,50,NA,50,40,50,50,50,50,UID_F6F950AEEAEAA27353177E27C6BA7522-SRC_101001694,New Jersey,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveandWendy53,15,20,"70 Rowes Wharf, Boston, MA 02110-3354"

10281867,89575,60745,Boston Harbor Hotel - Amazing!,"We recently spent a weekend at the Boston Harbor Hotel and booked our stay through the Disney Vacation Club. We had never been to Boston before and wanted to stay somewhere in a central location convenient to attractions. Well this hotel was perfect for that! We loved it and would definitely stay there again. The location was great since it was in a short  walking distance to Fanueil Hall, the Aquarium, the whale watching tours and ferry’s, Chinatown and the downtown financial district. The service there was amazing. The concierge was very helpful even before we got there. I had contacted them regarding a map of the area and they e-mailed me one right away. They were helpful and knowledgeable about the area when we asked them about certain activities once we got to Boston as well. The hotel staff was courteous and held the doors open for you when you left and arrived back to the hotel. That made us feel like VIP’s.  Coming back at night there was a staff member at the elevators asking to see our room key, which made us feel very safe that they had that kind of security. (Even though at no time did we feel threatened at all). The hotel store in the lobby has some cute Boston memorabilia, not much but what they did have was good quality. The rooms were really nice. They only had harbor view rooms when we made the reservation and the view was amazing. We would just stand at the window and stare out to the water each morning. From there you can see the ferry’s taking off and coming in, sailboats floating by and small boats bobbing in the water all around.  The room we stayed in was immaculate and nicely laid out. It had a flat screen TV and a DVD player. They had a fully stocked mini bar and snacks, but we didn’t take advantage of that. They also had other small details such as with the ice bucket came glasses and a wine opener. Our room also came with a nice plush robe and slipper for our use during our stay. A nice touch was the turn down service that we got each night around 9pm. They set up a small cloth at each side of the bed with the slippers tied with a ribbon around them. They also leave a small bottle of Fiji water on each nightstand with a glass and put the alarm clock radio on a soothing sounds station. The toiletries that are in the bathroom smell amazing and are for sale in the lobby store and the apples and mints left on the elevator hall table came in handy when running out to go sightseeing. Everything about the hotel felt luxurious. Although we didn’t eat at any of the restaurants we did have a drink at the bar by the lobby. It was small, but very nice and was a step away from the back doors that went right out onto the harbor. All in all it was a great hotel that I would highly recommend.",0,"October 24, 2007", October 2007,50,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,UID_F937F1585C946DCDDE9D9B6C405721F9-SRC_10281867,"Cranford, New Jersey",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Luv2Travel6324,2,5,"70 Rowes Wharf, Boston, MA 02110-3354"
102904624,89575,60745,An amazing getaway,"My wife and I wanted a short getaway close to home and decided on the Boston Harbor Hotel.  I had booked a city view deluxe room, but when we checked in we got bumped up to a city view suite.  The room felt like a small apartment.  There was a sitting room with a 42"" plasma TV and comfortable couch.  The bedroom was on the corner of the hotel and had a stunning view of Boston.  One of the best nights sleep I've had in a while.  Room service was also top notch.  Not only was delivery always pleasant, but the quality of the food was as good as any upscale restaurant.

However to my shock & amazement this fairly expensive hotel allows dogs. We were located in a room next to a dog that barked incessantly at dinner time and early morning, perhaps when the owners left the room. The Front desk manager confirmed that dogs are permitted and placed in rooms throughout the hotel. There are NO dog-free floors. So if you are allergic or a light sleeper you might be careful.I would have rated this hotel higher if they told me about the pet policy so I could get a room far away from barking dogs.

I stayed here for a conference and was given a room overlooking the water (I belong to the frequent guest club that the hotel belongs to) and the room was clean, very comforatable and nicely decorated.  I appreciated the long hallway from the door to the sleeping area since it blocked some noise.  I must say though that the plumbing from adjoining or nearby rooms was a little on the loud side.  The staff I interacted with were very professional, helpful and pleasant.  It is convenient to Faneuil Hall, but perhaps not readily apparent becasue of the various streets to be crossed to get there - it isn't particularly scenic out front of the hotel.

The staff would greet us in the morning and upon on return as if we traveling dignitaries...incomparable.  However, we found our room to be overly warm for sleeping comfort and were unable to resolve this during our 3 night stay.

107541847,89575,60745,Never going back!,"Tooootally overrated!! Maybe they treat conference guests different than others but I didn't have a fantastic experience here- contrary to most reviewers. My husband and I got in late Tuesday night for a stay through Saturday. First impression was a total wow. Everyone was really nice. We didn't get the waterfront view- but the view of the city was nice. The room looked really nice-very colonial- beds turned down when we got in the room. It wasn't until daylight though that I started noticing the ""scratches and dents"" so to speak.First, the bathroom was not great. The shower was horrible. There was barely any water pressure. The toilet made a weird beeping sound- intermittently. I couldn't tell what exactly would set it off but every so often it would just start chirping. Our room was very small so you could barely open the door without hitting the corner the closet was built into. Room service could barely get a cart through. I practically walked into it several times coming into the room. The last really terrible part about the place is the walls are paper thin!!!! I could hear everything and we were right next to the elevator so that's all I could ever hear- especially in the morning. It was sooooo annoying- especially when I wanted to sleep in late on Saturday. Oh also- there was construction or something going on and without warning when I walked out the back door I got sprayed over my head by the guy washing windows. Not cool.The hotel is actually in a very good location. Close to Quincy Market/Fanueil Hall, T stops, the New England Aquarium and a short-ish walk to Little Italy.The ""service"" and employees are great but you sure do pay for it. It's like my husband says- the price of the hotel is really just for the service. It wasn't a spectacular facility. It felt very old. Everyone was nice up until check out. Once I got home I realized there was an extra breakfast charge on our room. The guy I spoke with on the phone at the front desk was very terse and treated me like a peasant.

Our initial plans were to stay at the Four Seasons Boston, however after unsuccessfully trying to book a room online for the four of us (they only allow three to a room) we decided to stay here and am very happy we did!  We will definitely be back to stay here next time we are in Boston.",0,"July 1, 2011", June 2011,50,NA,50,40,NA,NA,50,50,UID_64A4CA2AA503CFA3B385E5F0D2F4C867-SRC_114932358,"Chicago, Illinois",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bakerGirl718,4,3,"70 Rowes Wharf, Boston, MA 02110-3354"
115104954,89575,60745,Charming hotel with great service,"We just returned from a relaxing and enjoyable stay at the Boston Harbor Hotel. We stayed as part of the AmEx FHR package and were very pleased. The staff is professional and helpful. The concierge Nathan, was outstanding. He was very honest about what was worth our time and what was not-you just felt you got the ""inside truth"" about Boston from him instead of a host of brochures and no real guidance. Check in and check out was very efficient. The rooms were well appointed. I had trouble with an outlet plug not working and they quickly replaced it. The Health Club has a nice variety of machines and weights. The pool and hot tub tub are very nice, located in the basement of the hotel. The bathroom in the Spa area was a little dated-old tiles and pink stalls in the bathroom but very clean and ample supplies available. The only real negative I have is that the service at the Sea Grille (where we ate breakfast) was a little inconsistent. It was a buffet on the weekend and on one occasion we had to request that several items be re-stocked. Tables were not always turned over very efficiently during the busy time of the morning either.  All in all, a really nice hotel that I would definitely stay at again.

115451454,89575,60745,Great Hotel!,"We have been to Boston sooo many times and stayed many places (the Langham, Louis XV, Ritz Carlton, Taj, Swisshotel.) This is our new favorite. We have five children, including two tots. The adjoining rooms were very spacious, the staff were very nice to the kids. They were given coloring books at check-in and got very nice milk and cookie platters every night. My husband and I had both stayed here on different business trips a decade plus ago and the hotel overlooked the infamous ""big dig,"" a real eyesore. Even if you don't get a harbor view room (which, sadly, we did not), you now overlook the city and beautiful green space.Our package included breakfast, which was buffet. Hate this. With lots of kids, this is not fun ... the constant up and down having to fetch for everyone. I'm sure for others this is a perk. They originally sat us sooo far away from the buffet. When we insisted on relocation, they politely accommodated us.  We have our own boston babysitter, so my husband and I had dinner one night at the hotel's restaurant right on the harbor. It was a beautiful spot, very peaceful yet people watching and boat watching made it fun. Service was great, food was average.Valeting parking is $44!!!

The view is gorgeous with the airport in the background.  Water, beautiful watercraft, planes taking off and landing yet none of the noise!  Wow, what a sunset on that bay!! One thing about the 9th floor... there is a Rotunda with the entrance on this floor where they cater events.  Luckily our room was far from the Rotunda but we did get caught one evening trying to get to our room from the elevator.  There was an even that was ending and the crowd gathered by the elevator and the hallway leading to the elevator was densely crowded and noisy.  I felt for the people in the rooms closest to the noise then.  That had to be annoying but then again, it may not have lasted long.The room itself was immaculate.  Having 2 TVs was a plus.  One in the sitting area where we could enjoy the sunlight and views and one in the bed area for late night or early morning watching.  The linens and bed-- to die for!!  Slept quite later than we expected every morning there.We indulged in room service a few times.  The food was great...from the wine selection to the cheese and fruit plate and the best breakfast omelets!!!  The service was even better.  They truly offered a 4 star experience...everyone from the concierge to the front desk to the valet and even the chambermaid were just great!!   The concierge was very knowledgable and helpful.  There recommendations were right on and they were able accept payment and print tickets for Boston Tours right at the desk.The location is central to the Financial District which offered a decent night life if you wanted it.  We found ourselves in Back Bay - near the Prudential Center- most often for the 'Chi Chi' shopping and restaurants.

117475173,89575,60745,Bad taste from the beginning.,"I want to preface my review with the fact I do not particularly like the ridculously useless attention which some 5 star hotels provide.  I much prefer to have attention when I ask for an unreasonable request to be met with concern for me, not for the hotels bottom line with charges for internet access, pool access, etc.  We were at Boston Logan and needed a room for the night after our flight was canceled.  I googled ""Hotels in Boston"" and got a response from a 3rd party vendor which gave the option of the above hotel for a reasonable price.  Usually when in this situation I bid with Priceline to get a quick hotel room last minute, but decided to try this vendor.  The hotel listed sounded great, but after 10 days on vacation with the most recent stay at a wonderful B&B at Provincetown, this hotel made me feel bad from the start to finish.  First off we were given a city view in a hotel which looked empty, so I asked for a harborview room.  I have done this hundreds of times with hotels and if they have a room with my request they prefer to give it rather than disappoint the customer.  Well, the desk agent after collaboration with a superior tells me that for $50 they will give me an upgrade.  I tell her it really is not that important.We go upstairs and my wife reads somewhere that Wifi is an extra change and to use the pool cost $25.  Come on now, this stuff is not an extra.Next morning prior to our flight we do breakfast.  Well my wife orders the Corned Beef Hash with 2 poached eggs.  It comes to the table with the above and nothing else.  Well if you look at the menu it states ""all egg dishes come with toast and potatoes"",  this is stated at the top of the breakfast dishes.  Well I look at the dish figuring they forgot the toast as I have never eaten Corned Beef hash and eggs without toast, but at that moment the waitress asked if my wife needed toast.  Of course we said yes.  Later, my wife who studied the menu asked if she would get potatoes since it was stated clearly that all egg dishes come with potatoes and toast.  Well the waitress explained that corned beef hash dish with 2 eggs already had potatoes in the hash, so that was the potatoes.  OK, that is a ridiculous response, but OK whatever, we really don't need it, just kinda tired of getting the runaround with you guys.  When I get the bill we get a charge for the toast!!!  OK, the menu states clearly the toast is included in all of the egg meals, and also the fact you cannot eat corned beef and eggs without some type of grain.  Anyway, I gladly paid for it as it was inconsiquential in the total cost of everything, but from start to finish nothing but bad taste.  This is the first negative review I have ever written, but I must say  this hotel is not for me.  Did I mention the mini fridge had a lock on it !  Yes you have to call someone to come and open it for you.  OK, lets get dressed, sit in the bed and wait for an attendant to come into our room, while we sit patiently for him to arrive.

The excellent concierge helped plan two family dinners who took away the anxiety of managing overtired  hungry kids. It was easy to checkin and effortless to get to the aquarium and Faneuil hall.And yet there were a few details of our stay that prompted me to write this review.First there is no in-room coffee or complementary coffee in the lobby. I met several disgruntled guests searching for coffee in the early a.m.; you had to wait to 7 to buy a small to go from their restaurant or walk down the block to Dunkin.Second there is no way to preview your bill on the tv or with a print out slipped under your door. I had to stand inline for 10 minutes and discovered not only was someone else's pricey sightseeing tour was put on my bill but also parking that was supposed to be included in my package. It was then another few minutes while those charges were removed.The hotel was clearly busy with weddings, families and guests. Robes were taken at turndown and not replaced. Our room was setup with linens and towels for three when there were four of us.  To me, it was a small yet steady lack of attention to details that I found surprisingLastly, we were entitled to hot cocoa and cookies via room service.

The Harbor Hotel could not have accommodated us better, they looked after us so well it has prompted me to make my first tripadvisor review! We traveled to the hotel from Logan airport using the water taxi which was a little time consuming but great fun! We booked a city view room but received a complimentary upgrade to a harbor view which was a lovely spacious room. My daughter was given cookies and milk every night which she loved. The room was very quiet and we slept very well in comfortable beds. Breakfast buffet was good but just one small complaint, the room is very small and we had to wait, but not for long! And we realised on our final day that you could order cooked items that were not on the buffet! We had drinks early evening in the bar, which was very nice and the staff were very kind to our daughter. One other small thing, and I hate to say this having had such a lovely stay, but I think the hotel is probably in need of a complete upgrade as it is looking a little tired and it is a bit outdated now. Finally, on a positive note, I really want to thank the Concierge staff who made us feel so welcome and looked after our every need.

We were always greeted with a smile and everyone new our name - always addressed as Mr. L and/or Mrs. L.

Returning in the evening after dinner, the bed would be turned down, soft music playing, ice inthe ice bucket, soft lighting, bathroom made tidy, mnore Fiji water.

Had a good breakfast at the waterview cafe restaurant on the first floor.  We enjoyed the casual seating arrangement, which consisted of two easy chairs and a small couch in a U-shape around the table.  The food was good- nothing extraordinary, but tasty nonetheless and a great setting.  My kids loved the pool and hot tub.  I've stayed at many hotels with pools, and thought this one was one of the best.  It was much less hot and humid in the pool area than you usually get with an indoor pool.  Nice temperature, lots of pool toys and kickboards available for the kids, but also lanes for adult swim.  Very large hot tub.  The staff were friendly and helpful throughout the hotel, from the bellman to the waiters and others as well.

We had stayed at the BHH with a view of the harbor. Beautiful room. We walked in to a lovely room with classical music playing on the Bowes end table clock radio. Very nice. We dressed, shut it off as we left for the convention, returned to the classical music playing again. No turn down service had happened yet. Not thinking anything of it we shut it off. Turning in to bed, watching TV there was a clanging on what seemed to be pipes with a wrench type noise below the floor. This went on for about a half an hour then stopped. The loud banging started up again, I called the front desk as to report the noise and asked what was below our room, nothing but storage.? The noise stopped. Half an hour later the noise, even louder than before seemed to be in the wall in front of me, the wall that seperated our room from the next room, a corner hotel room. This noise got louder and louder from one end of the wall to the other, sounding just as if someone was hitting pipes with a wrench. I called the front desk again and they said there was no one in the next room, or below us. Staying awake most of the night, I finally drifted to sleep with the noise continuing on and off.

126473642,89575,60745,A hotel that demonstrates The Golden Rule.,"This is my first review on tripadvisor, where I think it will do the most good. This hotel gave me such a fantastic experience that it seems wrong to keep it to myself. I would like to start out by saying that I didn't even get to spend twelve hours here, since it was sort of a pit stop between having dinner with an old friend and an early morning flight home to California, but I still experienced a thoroughly wonderful stay and was actually sad to leave. I checked in around 9:30 PM after every single staff member had greeted me (and opened every door, including the elevator). Since I had booked through a third party discount deal, I was completely flabbergasted to find that they had placed me on a high floor with a stunning view of the harbor, which was utterly breathtaking in the morning. Every nook and cranny was gracefully clean and well-appointed. As someone who is in charge of cooking and serving breakfast at home, it seemed a waste to pass up a rare chance to have a customized breakfast order, so I placed one for 7:00 AM before enjoying a shower and good night's sleep in some seriously quality linens. The next morning the food got me out of bed right on time, and the poor guy was nothing but gracious as I stumbled around sleepily in a robe and slippers (both the hotel's) trying to politely decline his offer to pour my coffee, which was lovely and hot even after he had left. My last half hour at the Boston Harbor was spent savoring a quiet and fantastic fresh breakfast overlooking a ridiculously beautiful view --  feeling sort of like a princess or at least a temporary member of the ""one percent"" -- before it was off to the airport and back to reality. Of course, I didn't have to lift a finger or even really ask the staff to help me get a taxi -- all part of the service, an expression you don't hear anymore because full service is so hard to find in 2012. I have never stayed in a hotel that took so much care and effort to make EVERY guest feel welcome and comfortable each step of the way. My only (tiny) lament is that the old friend from the night before made me promise not to book a hotel, and stay with her instead, the next time I visit Boston. Ah ...

We have stayed in many 'high-end' hotels throughout North America and I can't say enough about the Boston Harbor Hotel. Why so different from the rest? Lets start with the nickel and dime routine that all the others use after you check in(are you listening Westin, Hyatt. and Four Seasons?) NOT the Boston Harbor Hotel thankyou very much. Fresh bottled water placed on your nightstand every night. Fresh fruit and candy mints throughout the hotel. NO CHARGE for wi-fi. WHAT?!! NO CHARGE? What high-end hotel does all that? The Boston Harbor Hotel.And that is not the best part of the place. No, that would be reserved for the people that work there. From the moment we walked onto the premises we were treated like family. It was difficult to leave as I really felt we knew each other well.As for the building itself and the location it was top notch. Our room was extremely spacious with a harbor view. The rotunda that distinguishes the Boston Harbor Hotel form all the rest of the city is a stunning masterpiece. When you see the Boston skyline your eyes are always drawn to the large oval rotunda. Its almost unfair they have it.Our only small complaint was the noise form some minor maintenance that was happening close to our room but it was not that bad. It happens everywhere you go and sometimes you hit it at the wrong time. We never told the front desk about it and Im sure they would have moved us if we wanted it.Thankyou to the Boston Harbor Hotel for making our stay in Boston a great holiday.",0,"March 23, 2012", March 2012,50,NA,30,50,50,50,50,50,UID_CEA2A41278E71EF0AB11EA3D36637B4C-SRC_126548588,"Vancouver, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lovethoseggs,4,2,"70 Rowes Wharf, Boston, MA 02110-3354"

I have to say I was a little worried that the hotel wasn't going to be child friendly. Fortunately it was! They treated my son like a very special guest. They gave him coloring books and crayons and he even got a special plate of milk and cookies delivered to our room just for him. The staff new him by name and we were only there one night.

126747490,89575,60745,Classic Elegance on the Water,"Bottom line up front: I enjoyed my time at the hotel and would definitely stay there again.  My husband and I stayed here for a wedding in March '12 and were very pleased with the accommodations and friendliness/helpfulness of the staff.   The hotel itself is very elegant and caters to higher end travelers, which is evident from the second you arrive to be greeted by their doormen, bellhops and front desk service, which was outstanding.   The concierge was very helpful, even in finding a salon close by for my husband to get an emergency hair cut Saturday morning of the wedding!  The parking rates are a bit steep but if you fly into Logan, there really isn’t a reason to rent a car in Boston- everything is accessible by foot, taxi or the “T.”  This hotel is situated within walking distance of Boston’s North End- the Italian district- which is home to some of the city’s most fabulous cafes and restaurants.  However, I did order a lunch and breakfast from room service while staying the weekend and the food was fabulous.  Probably the best tasting and best presented in-room breakfast experience I’ve had and the phone service to order was very courteous.   When I called at peak times, they did not keep me on hold, called me back immediately, and also gave a exact time the food would be at my door.   The fitness facility at the hotel is complimentary to all guests (becoming a rarity now a days at high end spa/fitness facilities) and was relatively well sized, well equipped with new machines, free weights and cardio equipment.   I did not use the pool but the locker rooms were very clean and had plenty of space.  As for the room itself, there were a few things here and there that could have used a touch up (corner molding and wallpaper was cracked/worn in a few locations) but overall, it was very pleasant.  We had a city-view room on the top floor and the layout of the room was a “U” shape which seemed a bit odd at first but turns out to work well providing a nice separate dining/desk area but that is not good if you plan on watching TV while eating or working at the desk.   The closet and draw space was sufficient for even a week’s stay.   The bathroom was a bit on the small side- I always prefer to have more space between the door swing and the toilet- but it was nicely decorated.   I would say the only disappointment was the shower head, it was “efficient” but I love a good hot shower with LOTS of water when I’m travelling.  I hate to say it but I think the Westin hotel chain still has the best shower heads.     The maid service was spectacular and she was very nice at bringing extra towels and filling the ice bucket (no machines) even though we didn’t want a full turn down service one night.  The next night when we got back to the room, the turn down was done well, ice filled and water bottles left behind as well as the slippers by the bed.  If you are looking at this hotel for a wedding, I’d highly recommend it for the reception from a guest’s point of view.  I thought the venue was beautiful overlooking the harbor and the service was again, spectacular.  The food was good and the portions were huge but I had filled up on so many of the delicious hand passed apps during cocktail hour.  In looking at the bride’s photos taken at the hotel, it was also a beautiful outdoor venue for pictures before the reception if you like water scenery.",0,"March 27, 2012", March 2012,50,NA,40,40,40,50,50,50,UID_F9585DBB689113FEE7CF04105D8DFD55-SRC_126747490,"Boston, Massachusetts",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AMES1811,6,4,"70 Rowes Wharf, Boston, MA 02110-3354"

Walking distance to Faneuil Hall, The Aquarium and downtown Boston. The customer service is top notch and the indoor pool is great for both adults and kids.

127661915,89575,60745,You MUST read this if you are considering staying in Boston,"We were at the Hay Adams (opposite the White House), followed by the Ritz Carlton in Central Park, NYC (both superb hotels) immediately prior to arriving at the Boston Harbour, which I really didn't expect would compare with our previous American hotels on this trip. I had done a late switch from the Boston W, as I wanted a sea view and a friend told me I'd hate the trendy bathrooms at the W. This hotel has been the surprise of our trip.                         If you are reading this, you are most likely wondering where to stay in Boston. Look no further. The Boston Harbour is way ahead of the curve and to such a degree that I'm seriously impressed. The clientele seems circa 70% relaxed businessmen and 30% tourists.                                                               As always, it's only when the staff at a hotel work as a superbly well co-ordinated team that something really special emerges. At the Boston Harbour the service, the efficiency, the care to detail and the total competence makes it a pleasure to be a guest.                        Examples: I told the hotel that one of my daughters is coeliac. Nobody on the property had to be told a second time....it was sorted.....and they deliver gluten free homemade miniature cakes every evening. We needed extra hangers....the fast-dial button for housekeeping didn't work on one of our three telephones and so I called the concierge with my request for hangers.....I later noticed that they replaced the telephone with a brand new one. Everyone is immaculately turned out, especially the housekeeping staff who are also spot-on with every request and quick.                                                                                       The Concierge Desk is firing on all cylinders. Ronnie Lamming, one of the concierges, is the best I've encountered anywhere in the world, since I stayed at The Setai in Miami two years ago where they also have a fantastic concierge service. It was a joy to discuss Boston with Ronnie, given it was our first visit to the city.  I have a love/hate relationship with concierges.....e.g. I detest them at Trump and I'm appalled by the mafia-like activities at some other hotels. Few are perfect. Here, the Concierge desk is state of the art and will greatly enhance any visit. All their advice has been good. They also got us best seats for the opening of Riverdance at the Opera House and Red Sox tickets for the first game of the 100th season, both last minute.                                                      From the reception, to the door team, housekeeping, restaurant staff, concierge....it's impressively together. I tend to post on Tripadviser when somewhere is terrible or very good. The Boston Harbour is absolutely first class. Too many top hotels have beds that need replacing....not here. Pillows are also high quality. Rooms are very well fitted out. However what makes this hotel extra special are the huge windows overlooking the harbour. If in Boston on business, why stay down anywhere else when you can have a full-on harbour view and feel like you are on vacation. Similarly the view from breakfast restaurant makes a great start to the day....as do the breakfasts. From perfect freshly squeezed orange juice to the Pellegrino house water, it's very good. One day I wanted a bagel with lox (smoked salmon). Our waiter, a smiling lady called Susan asked me what type of bagel, they have them all. I then asked if they has Low Fat cream cheese. They did. I then wondered if by any chance they had low fat cream cheese with chives? Susan went off and brought it, having chopped up the chives and mixed them in herself. I'm not a VIP guest, they don't know me from Adam, this is the standard of treatment everyone receives here.         The gym/pool is also first rate. As I'm travelling with two young daughters, I love the fact that they have times when children cannot use the pool. That way, adult guests can hardly complain when children make a little noise. The leisure facilities and staff are lovely.                          The shower works well. As does everything else in our accomodation. So it should, you may say. That is not the reality. At Sandy Lane, Barbados, one of the leading hotels in the world, room equipment has been a constant, ongoing irritation. After 8 stays over the past 4 years and after paying them a fortune for the privilege, I won't return.                                                                I will return to Boston and I will 100% certainly return to the Boston Harbour hotel. It is exceptional value for money, unlike Sandy Lane. Given how easy it is to get around Boston, why stay anywhere else? Finally the bell desk (as good as it gets)  also double at driving guests about in the hotel sedan. One night I was embarrassed as I kept the car waiting 20 minutes beyond pick-up time following a superb dining experience at the plush 2nd floor restaurant in the Legal Sea Foods building....another terrific concierge recommendation. I would have been on time but for an exceptional experience there.....but that's for another review....but do also go dine there. We love Boston.

12803491,89575,60745,Very good hotel,"I normally stay at the InterContinental but it was full for two days of my stay so I tried the Boston Harbour. I was very pleasantly surprised despite some of the mixed reviews on the site. The hotel is very elegant and I believe marketed at a well heeled, older crowd. The furnishings – darker wood, elaborate carpets and Oriental furniture pieces suggested this to me. Late night check-in was painless with a bell man waiting to take my suitcase from the curb; check-in paperwork already pre-prepared and 24 hour room service if I was hungry. The room was nicely prepared for a midnight arrival with one lamp on; bed turned down and a nice stereo playing classical music. The room was very good and an interesting layout with a hallway, powder area leading to a bathroom and a separate living area. This layout gave a very large feeling to the room and it was shame I couldn’t enjoy it for a longer period of time – had no time to even sit in the living area. The room had a very nice flat screen tv; large clock radio with excellent stereo; an additional TV in the living area and was spotlessly clean. Biggest complaint about the room was the noise. The ‘hallway’ area within the room leading from the door is ceramic/marble. This conducts the noise very well from the doorway which is a relatively thin door with a gap. One can easily hear people passing in the hall and especially when doors are slammed. There were at least two occasions when I checked the door was actually closed! When someone was knocking at a neighbouring door I had to check that it was not my own. There was one occasion when I actually thought someone had entered my room but it was the noise of people moving in next door.Hotel gyms are important to me. This facility at the Harbour was quite good but definitely not as good as the InterConti. To start with the InterConti manages to keep its gym open 24 hours – not sure why the Harbour can’t do the same. They seem to have a large staff at the facility and perhaps staff cost is a reason but for your average business person, personal trainers and other advisors are not required. Equipment is good although a bit on the 90’s side but all had mini televisions hooked up. Lots of free weights and good stationary equipment but not the top of the line range. Main restaurant which is an upmarket café of some sorts was quite good for breakfast although a bit noisy. Serving staff was excellent and I enjoyed some privacy at the breakfast bar. Breakfast menu was very good and quite reasonably priced for a hotel at this level. I ate across the street at an Italian restaurant recommended by the Concierge – Umbria – very good. Nice change from hotel food which looked a bit poncy and over priced. Overall, an excellent hotel; great staff; free wifi in my room (either intentional or broken) was a very pleasant surprise – ironically, the more expensive a hotel is, the more likely they are to gouge you on wifi. Would definitely stay here again but the Interconti down the street is a bit more my style.I would like to have seen in room recycling and at least the illusion that the environement was cared for with a policy on ""towel on floor or hang-up"" option.",0,"January 19, 2008", January 2008,50,NA,NA,40,50,50,50,50,UID_8F02DB568976CEB2DB5F8F51CDE48ACF-SRC_12803491,"Singapore, Singapore",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BusyFlyingAround,368,290,"70 Rowes Wharf, Boston, MA 02110-3354"

128224380,89575,60745,5* luxury and amazing service,"I've just returned from my first trip to Boston, and stayed at Boston Harbour Hotel on the recommendation of some colleagues. This hotel definitely lives up to all the glowing reviews. From the moment you arrive, you are treated as a VIP. Nothing is too much trouble for the staff who are polite yet friendly and welcoming. The building is impressive, much more than the standard glass and concrete block. The location could not be better, and my harbour view room was excellent, the view over the bay incredible. Sunrise over the still waters took my breath away.All the food and drink at the hotel were superb, beautifully presented, but it's true it is a little pricey. The spa, pool and jacuzzi were lovely, and very quiet during my stay. Cleaniness is clearly a high priority for the spa staff, the whole area was spotless (as is the hotel in general).The type of service that impressed was when the bell boy who had assisted me on arrival saw me again the next morning, he remembered my name instantly, why I was in Boston, offered some water for my walk and was totally charming. This first class service really sets this hotel apart from the others and would make you always choose this hotel again. There is a small amount of noise from some of the planes arriving and departing from the airport but you would get that at any Boston hotel, I suspect. Slightly more annoying is that I could hear conversations from everyone who walked past the room door. Late at night, this is intrusive.

When a medical issue arose and we had to take our little boy to the emergency room one evening, the staff sprang into action--we were whisked into the hotel car, a stuffed toy somehow became cradled in my son's arms, and before I knew it, we were at the ER. Fortunately, my son was ok and for the rest of the trip it seemed that every employee in the hotel asked about his well-being by name.

But on this trip it was our good fortune to stay at the Boston Harbor Hotel.  If you wish to be on the Boston harbor -- this is your hotel!The staff -- especially the Concierge staff -- are top-notch.  We had tickets to the theatre on Friday night and asked for a recommendation for a restaurant near the Lyric Theatre.  We were steered to the Bistro du Midi on Boyleston, just a short walk from the Theatre.  (See my separate review on Bistro du Midi.)Our mini-suite at the BHH included a king-size bed with down comforter -- one of the better beds we've ever experienced in a hotel.  Each side of the bed had a large bedside table, my side with a duplex outlet to plug in my phone charger and our white-noise machine.The attached room had a work desk with plenty of outlets plus flawless WiFi service.  The room had two dressers with great storage space, so we weren't living out of our suitcases during our four-day stay.We had lunch our first day by ordering to-go soup and sandwiches from the hotel's Sea Breeze restaurant's ""food cart"" on the dock at the rear of the hotel.  We took our meal and sat at a table right on the dock in front of the yachts.  Quite a treat on a beautiful day!If your trip to Boston revolves around the waterfront restaurants and tourist spots, the BHH is absolutely your best top-level choice.  If your trip is more attuned to shopping or theatre -- say, in the Back Bay area up and down Boyleston -- you might want to choose a property in that area.But if you want a deluxe weekend experience at a world-class hotel in Boston, you simply cannot beat the Boston Harbor Hotel!",0,"May 19, 2012", May 2012,50,NA,50,40,50,40,50,50,UID_332C24A075DAD02D997416B2F10E38FA-SRC_130213752,Kansas City,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/captmike123,26,20,"70 Rowes Wharf, Boston, MA 02110-3354"

It's convenient for both Freedom Trail tourists and financial center business travelers, and easily reached by public transportation (from Logan, take the Blue Line to the Aquarium stop.)I had a junior king suite with a very nice city view.  It had a separate living area with a work desk, television, sofa and chair, the very comfortable king-sized bed with another television, and a bathroom area.  The bathroom amenities are higher end and even include liquid laundry soap.  There is a minibar with some directions on how to use the refrigerator for your own items.There is both wired and wireless Internet.  I wasn't able to get the wireless to work, but the wired was fine.  Both are complimentary.  A business center off the gift shop has computers, printers and copiers.  You have your choice of newspapers, rather than only the customary USA Today.The health club is excellent with a variety of cardio machines, weights, a pool, and even personal trainers (for a fee.)  A number of spa treatments are also available.The staff is uniformly friendly and helpful.  Your wake-up call comes from a live person, not a recording.  There is an evening turndown service (but no chocolate on the pillow!)As a road warrior, I'm not looking for a great hotel experience.  If I get one that's a bonus, but I'm more interested in small things that make the time away from home less painful. Two things missing here:1.  Convenient check-out.  There's no statement under your door; you'll have to go down to the desk to check out.  That was fine for me this trip, but if there were a line, I'd have been running late to my meeting.2.  No in-room coffee.  I'm not sure why upscale hotels find coffeemakers beneath them, but many do and this is no exception.

My first room was so loud that it seemed like the elevator control room was in my hotel room. There were constant sounds of people talking in the corridors, and even a dog barking away around 1 or 2am. I got about 3 hours of sleep that night. I got moved to the 'quieter'  tower. I was taking a conference call from the room around 3pm and could literally hear the jangling keys and rustling of a garbage bag by one of the housekeepers walking by. I then checked out and moved next door to the Intercontinental. I would never re-book at this hotel until they figure out some sound attenuation. It's sad, because it is classic Boston with beautiful views and good restaurants, and a stellar location.

131115314,89575,60745,The Hotel Highlight of our New England Trip!,"Just got back from our week stay in the New England and could not wait to review this place. The only sad thing about this place was that it was our first hotel stay of the trip and set the bar way too high for any other New England hotel to match. We took the red eye flight in from Los Angeles so when we landed at Logan at 5am we were zombies. It's really easy to get here from Logan via the ""T"". All you have to do is take the Silver Line to the South Station and it's a short walk up Atlantic (We wish we knew this when we first got there). Knowing that our hotel check in wasn't until 4pm we wondered over to the hotel to simply check our bags and wonder around town. The front desk was extremely gracious by seeing if there was something they could do to help us out and gave us our 4pm check in at 7am! Once we got to our room we were quite impressed with the size of it. It was very spacious and very comfortable. I've read some of the reviews about the style being old fashioned or outdated in this hotel but after checking it out it wasn't old fashion. It was a bit more turn of the century and Art-Deco in it's design. Sure it wasn't one of the modern design places like the Intercontinental a few places over but I come from LA where every hotel looks like that. The Boston Harbor Hotel gave me a little more of a New England Feel and for that I am very grateful.  When we finally crashed on the bed we laid down of one of the softest most comfortable mattresses we've ever slept on in our lives. It was like sleeping on a cloud. I took advantage of the Fitness Center and was very impressed with it. I loved the salt water pool and was impressed with the locker room which had a sauna and amenities for me to shower, shave and start my day. The hotel also sits on the harbor with a beautiful boardwalk at it's back door. This hotel was truly the hotel highlight of our trip and cannot express how pleased we were with our experience. No other hotel was able to live up to this hotels experience. If you have the dough to shell out for a little luxury, make the Boston Harbor Hotel your choice.

The food is great - we ate breakfasts, one lunch, and one dinner there - delicious food but expensive.  Good wine list - I can't say enough good things about the staff - they are so friendly - know your name - and do everything they can to be helpful and responsive.  The concierge staff is particularly fantastic! The hotel is just a short walk to the Aquarium - and subway.  We took cabs everywhere and the doorman is right there to assist you.

I looked at the other room which was certainly no better than the original room. I was not offered any other consideration or adjustment to my current room rate nor was I offered an apology. In addition, we later discovered that room 842 was adjacent to the housekeeping room and hence we were subjected to unnecessary noise each day early in the morning.Upon checkout, I again expressed my displeasure with the room to Daniel, the front desk clerk and received a ""deer in the headlights"" response. All other staff including bell men, housekeepers, concierge, wait staff, etc. were excellent and obviously well trained. This is a hotel with 5 star service with the exception of the front desk clerk. The marketing of the rooms should clearly indicate that some rooms have partial harbor views.

It had a large bathroom with a full-length mirror, large mirror and closet in the entry hall, king-sized bed, TV in the bedroom, sitting area with couch, chair, desk and another TV, and a large window overlooking the city.  If it had a small kitchen, it could have passed as an efficiency apartment.    We had a view of the city from our window.

Whether we were entering the building, at the front desk, in the dining room, or lounge,  the entire staff was engaged and courteous, ready to serve at a moment’s notice.  This was really the most noticeable stand-out for me.  They really went out of their way to remember our names, asked us several times how our stay was, and they were quick to help in any way possible.The food was delicious.  We had a full breakfast out on the terrace, overlooking several large boats.  Each evening we would go over to Rowes Wharf where they had a great menu as well.

The hotel itself is situated on the harbour and during the Summer months they take advantage of this by hosting bands and movies shown on a huge screen. At breakfast our son enjoyed watching all the planes arriving and departing from Logan Airport. The hotel is elegant as are the rooms with very comfortable beds and large bathrooms and sitting areas. We ate all of our  breakfasts as well as one dinner in the main resturant and the food was very good. The service at the hotel from the frontdesk to housekeeping is efficient and very friendly. The fitness center is extremely well equiped and the indoor pool is large enough to swim lengths. My 11 year son woke up one morning with a very sore neck that was so painful we paid $350 for a doctor to come to the hotel and examine him. At the end he simply told us to give him advil and apply heat. One of the fitness center staff over heard my son complaining about how painful it was and took it upon himself to mix up some home remedy and then spend an hour massaging it onto our sons neck. He then took the time to follow up the next day to see if our son was feeling better which he was. The hotel emplyee even refused a tip that I offered saying he was just happy our son was feeling better.

We usually get a room with the city view but this time we got a room with the harbor view. Our room was on the 14th floor and what a fantastic panoramic view we had of Boston harbor. It was fascinating watching all of the activity that was going on in Boston harbor.  The city view rooms are also great with the  Rose Kennedy Greenway right in front of the hotel. The rooms are very nicely appointed and very quiet. The hotel is on the Boston waterfront and within walking distance of the new seaport district, The North End,  The N.E. Aquarium, Children’s Discovery Museum, The Institute of Contemporary Art, The Boston Tea Party Ship & Museum, Harbor Cruise Ships, Godzilla high speed thrill boat ride, Boston Duck Boat Tours, Faneuil Hall Market Place and much more.

All of the hotel staff are very friendly and are definitely there to do all they can to make your stay a memorable one. This year it happened to be our 40th anniversary and the hotel management surprised us with a bottle of champagne and a desert tray in our room. I would strongly suggest that you have dinner at the Rowes Wharf Grill at the hotel. The food and service there is absolutely outstanding. The meal portions are actually the size a normal person can actually eat. I had the grilled tuna that was cooked perfectly. I’m not a dessert eater but I always have dessert there because they are excellent and just the right portion size. If you decide to have lunch or dinner at the Rowes Wharf Grill ask to have Adrian as your server, I guarantee you will have a great time. The restaurant also has a great outdoor eating area that faces Boston harbor. It is open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. We also had three wonderful breakfasts there. Two in the restaurant and one room service. The room service was a treat. The server who set up our room service is a sweetheart, it was the second time she served us. After dinner check out the Rowes Wharf Bar. We always have a great time talking to the bartender, Jeremy. The bar also has an extensive selection of single malt Scotch whiskies.

The views were incredible though, so peaceful to look over the harbor.  The service was also excellent.

It has a genteel atmosphere that is perfectly suited to Boston and leaves you feeling very well taken care of.  It’s not cheap, but not outrageously expensive and you get what you’re paying for here.  We booked a deluxe harbor view room and it was worth the upgrade.The room was gorgeous, and huge, with a sitting area, two flat-screen TV’s, a dressing area with closet and bench, and a good sized marble bathroom. My tastes generally run to a more modern style, but this was elegant and traditional without feeling at all stuffy or tired.  The bed was super comfortable.  Lighting was good.  Closet and drawer space was plentiful.  Amenities included an iron and board, and a good hairdryer.   What really distinguished the hotel was all the little extra thoughtful touches, such as a lighted makeup mirror, and not only a phone next to the toilet, but a shelf with notepad and pencil.  All the usual toiletries were provided, and some unusual ones – packets of Woolite and Shout if you need to wash out a few things or take care of stains, and some antiseptic hand wipes to use on the go during the day– very much appreciated!   A complimentary morning newspaper was delivered in a cloth bag hung on the doorknob.  Evening turndown service was the full deal, including fresh towels in the bathroom, bottles of water by the bed and a full ice bucket, and slippers placed on mats next to each side of the bed.There is a spa and health club downstairs, with a lap pool and large Jacuzzi hot tub, very nice for relaxing after a day of walking.  A great variety of top-notch exercise equipment, including some I’ve never seen before.  Two nice restaurants onsite – we ate dinner at Meritage and thoroughly enjoyed it (a wine bar where you can put together a sampling of small plates, or order a larger portion), and had breakfast outside one morning, expensive but lovely.Service was impeccable, in keeping with everything else about the hotel.

142325514,89575,60745,Very welcoming,"My husband and I recently spent a weekend at this hotel.  I chose it largely because of the location on the waterfront and was not disappointed.  When we arrived, we missed the driveway and were sitting in the car trying to decide how to maneuver when a bellman came to our car to ask if we needed help.  He told us how to get to the parking garage and we were rescued!  We did opt for self parking as we left the car until our trip north on Monday.Everyone we encountered on staff was very friendly and helpful.  The bellman who took us to our room was very welcoming and informative and got us some ice and water before leaving.  We had a wonderful view of the harbor.  The hotel is within walking distance of so many things and places that we walked everywhere!  Many restaurants, Faneuil Hall and the many shops there, Boston Common and the North End were also less than a mile each.One of the nicest things was the turn down service.  Each night there was ice, a bottle of water and a glass put on the nightstand, robe and slippers laid out, and a nice little bottle of pillow spray and sleep balm.  Such a cozy thing for a larger hotel to do!  We felt like we were coming home when we came in at night!Another nice touch is the bowl of apples by the elevator and small candies.  There are no coffee makers in the room, so we did get coffee in the lobby each morning.  The beds were very comfortable and the bath products smelled lovely.  We slept with the window open and it was very quiet at night and early morning.I did make our reservation via the I Prefer program which is free and has a few perks such as early check in/late check out, we had a small fruit plate waiting in the room one day, and easy to modify reservations.  I had booked the room months in advance, but the rate was lower a week before we went and I was able to get the lower rate.  Also, at checkout our self parking was validated for the whole weekend.

The bed with a pillow top was the most comfortable I have slept in at any hotel for years. The staff are friendly & accommodating & especially the waiters who brought our room service. The food served by room service was something else. We ordered two bowls of clam chowder. A Wharf salad & a Lobster salad croissant. The chowder should be called potato soup with 1 clam. It was thick and a little jelly like with many large chunks of potato, & one clam in its shell. It had not been cooked with the soup but dropped in later. The Wharf salad had a moderate amount of crab but not enough to make it really taste of crab. The lobster croissant had a layer of lobster salad about 1/4"" thick & all the lobster was shredded no larger chunks. The amount of mayo and other ingredients overwhelmed any lobster taste. The price for this simple room service meal was 93.00. Simple highway robbery at 25.00 for the sandwich. The next day for lunch at Burttons in Hingham we had lobster rolls that probably had about one quarter pound of lobster with identifiable chunks of both claw and tail meat for 17.00 a much better value.

The hotel style is classic and comfortable, and the lobby is beautiful and gets a lot of natural light.  During the time we were there, it was very busy but I never felt neglected.We stayed in the harbor view rotunda room, with a connecting double for our children.  The lady with whom I reserved the room said it was her favorite in the hotel.  We liked it very much. The rooms are a good size and the views are amazing.  The beds were very comfortable as well.One thing that impressed me very much is that there was never, not once, a mistake with the room service order (we ordered in a lot).  This is interesting to me because we travel a lot and stay in amazing places and usually someone forgets something, but not here.Wifi is free, but slow.I worked out a few days and found the gym very nice, with maintained equipment and a very helpful staff. I did not use the pool but it looked nice and clean.I will say that this hotel is very expensive but I guess you pay for the view.  Some things that can be improved are:The bathrooms. The price for the room is pretty high to be taking a shower in a bathtub/shower curtain thing.The airco/heating system.  Either we were too cold or way too hot. Rarely had a comfy temperature.Better insulation; we heard the elevator at night pretty clearly.But I would still come again because I didn't have one single issue with the service - everyone was so nice, and the concierges were top notch.

I cannot express how happy both of our families and all of our guests were with the service at BHH. We worked with Cortney Gould one of the wedding consultants, and she was beyond amazing. Her attention to detail, customer service, and sincerity were above and beyond. She was so calm throughout the whole process, responded to our emails immediately, was a wonderful mediator between family and caterers. People kept asking us why we did not have an outside wedding planner and we explained that Courtney basically was our wedding planner, but included in our wedding package there. There would not be any need to hire a separate wedding planner because she really does it all. We dropped everything  from frames to special wine glasses to special cookies we wanted included on side tables off the week prior to the wedding and Courtney handled it ALL. Every member of the staff that we encountered were so warm, welcoming and treated us and all of our family exceptionally. My grandfather was in a wheel chair because he had just broken his hip, and the staff was so helpful in making sure he was comfortable and giving him a special chair for the reception. We arrived early back from the ceremony at Old South Church, and the cocktail hour was all set up, the staff were prepared for us and greeted all of our guests with smiles, placing a drink in their hands right away as well as walking around with appetizers and reaching everyone very quickly (we had 185 guests). The food was absolutely AMAZING - we chose three options for the entree and had an appetizer and salad course, as well as two types of cake that were so rich and decadent. We also had a late night snack of sliders and fries that everyone loved, and a dessert table with homemade desserts from family members that BHH allowed us to bring in as well as some desserts they made. They were very accommodating to everyone staying later than expected at the ceremony - it was supposed to end at 1am and everyone did not leave the Wharf Room until closer to 1:30am. The brunch the next morning was delicious, too. Our bridal suite with our private balcony overlooking the harbor was so wonderful - the whole weekend was a dream come true, thanks to Courtney and the BHH staff.

The staff is SO FRIENDLY AND ACCOMODATING! We ordered room service and it came within 15 min. We used the pool area which was great. The view of the City was gorgeous, but I think the thing that my husband and I both agree on is that the rooms are alittle tired. I thought the decor in the hotel was alittle dated. The bathrooms are dated too. When we went 8 years ago we had not been to many other hotels in Boston, since then we have been to many others in the city.

Exceeded my expectations.  We had a harborview deluxe room and it was very spacious with the extra sitting area, which is really like a full living room and makes the room feel like a suite (although you cannot close off the living area from the bed area).  If we had a child with us it would have been plenty of space.  I specifically booked this room and this hotel because I wanted to see the fireworks over Boston harbor at midnight, and we had a perfect view!  I also mentioned that it was our anniversary and during turn down service the first night they left us a vey nice bottle of sparking wine (Mums) and a plate of deserts.  I was impressed.  There is a fridge in the room and the bathroom ammenities are plentiful (including little packets of wollitte and shout stain wipes).  We had room service breakfast both mornings which was very good, and our room rate came with a $66 credit for breakfast each day - which was good becuase it would have been $70-80 each day for 2 without the credit.

148894334,89575,60745,Excellent except for some minor flaws,"Stayed at the hotel over New Years. Did not have a Harbor View but the city view was quite nice. If you want to enjoy the view without booking a Harbor view room I would suggest sitting at the bar in their restaurant Meritage  excellent harbor views from there. Speaking of the bar very attentive bartenders and  the drinks and bar service was a solid 9 out of 10. As for the restaurant Meritage  IMO it's a solid 9 out of 10 for fine dining. Food quality, atmosphere, service and ambiance all very good. However if you are a big eater (portions) as opposed to being a foodie (quality) the portions are on the smallish side but that's to be expected in fine dining. Room service food was excellent 9 out of 10. Saw several dogs in the Hotel all well mannered and heard absolutely no barking my entire stay. It's nice to see a pooch here and there during my stay sort of like a doggie ambassador. My only semi negative was the spa: a little dated, lack luster service and the one thing that really irks me is that I have to look for a spa employee and ask him for a brush or a comb. Can't they just leave them out or are they worried about someone with enough $$ to stay at a high end hotel and book a spa service is going to walk away with all their 99 cent combs and brushes.Also, in the spa  they give you white fabric slippers which means if you are concerned about athletes foot or any other germ/critter that may be on the spa floor you have only one option, wear white cloth slippers in the shower/steam room etc. etc.etc...  then you get to walk around in wet slippers thereafter. How about they pony up for some nice plastic/rubber massaging slippers or flip flops that can be washed and disinfected. Also the waiting area prior to getting a massage is a cloth sofa in a hallway. No tv, no magazines, no juice or water within sight or reach, hardly what you would expect from a spa associated with a high end hotel. Plus if someone takes a steam/sauna/shower prior to going to the sofa to wait for their treatment they leave the sofa moist/wet. Someone from management who has been to a really got hotel or casino spa should recognize and address these issues. On the positive side both my wife and I agree the massage itself was excellent. Mind you I'm a restaurant/hotel/spa snob and I rate my stay a solid 8 out of 10. Not quite the quality you would get in a high end Asian hotel but certainly top notch for the states. I would definitely stay there again",0,"January 5, 2013", December 2012,40,NA,50,30,40,50,50,40,UID_9E7C312534576FCC491E1D7E71691B2B-SRC_148894334,boston,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/worstew,10,28,"70 Rowes Wharf, Boston, MA 02110-3354"
148915358,89575,60745,Superior Hotel - A++ Service,"What can I say about the Boston Harbor hotel?  One word - superior.  I am a former Boston resident who visits the city yearly.  Boston is hands down one of my favorite cities in the U.S.  For this trip, I was visiting Boston with my two sons to simply hang out and enjoy the city.  I normally stay somewhere in the Back Bay near Boylston or Newbury Street when I am in town.  But, I decided to try staying down at the waterfront this time at the Boston Harbor Hotel.  So glad I did!  The Boston Harbor hotel is one of those hidden gems you come across once in a blue moon.  The service is top notch.  They are above par with some of the best hotels - Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton, & St Regis etc. with respect to their service.  I found their service to be understated, seamless, and efficient.  They are not pretentious yet very effective in ensuring their guests are well taken care of.  Every time I called the concierge to ask for something, they would go the extra mile.  For example, I called to inquire about the water taxi departure times to Charlestown.   They not only answered my questions but sent up a printed copy of the schedule to my room within 10 minutes.   They also had an extensive DVD library with kids movies in which you could check out a DVD and take back to your room - ensuring that my boys were happy.  The staff was extremely courteous, helpful, and polite.  They addressed me by name whenever I was in the lobby and helped with anything I needed to make my stay more enjoyable.  They even brought up milk and cookies for my boys each night.  After I returned home, I received a handwritten note from management thanking me for my visit to the hotel.  Very nice touch - top notch service!  We booked a city view deluxe room.  The room itself was extremely comfortable, spacious, and had great views of the city.  I also loved their bath products in the rooms - Asprey London.  These products smell heavenly.  Housekeeping even packed a small box of extra products for me to take back to Seattle.   We used the swimming pool and spa which were very nice, clean, and well maintained.  Even though the hotel was quite full when we were there, it did not feel crowded or busy.   The hotel is located in a great spot on the waterfront, particularly with kids.  We were minutes from the New England Aquarium, Boston Duck Tours, Quincy Market & Faneuil Hall, Codzilla boat ride (which my sons are crazy about), Rose Kennedy Parkway Greenway, and the Boston Children's Museum.  Also, we were only a short walk from the Aquarium T stop so well connected to the rest of the city.   The hotel is also very close to my favorite neighborhood in Boston - the North End.  I love this neighborhood and would travel to Boston just to eat the Italian food here.  Logan airport is also conveniently located to the hotel.  You can take a water taxi to the airport, if you are up for the adventure.   I would have to say the Boston Harbor Hotel may be one of my favorite hotels in the U.S.  It far exceeded my expectations.   I would highly recommend it and look forward to my next visit when I am back in Boston in the near future.",0,"January 5, 2013", June 2012,50,NA,50,40,50,50,50,50,UID_28CA452E0F5EC6F83D26605F23BFF9E9-SRC_148915358,"Seattle, Washington",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/greenlakegirl,32,67,"70 Rowes Wharf, Boston, MA 02110-3354"

We got to town late on Christmas Day and as our plans had changed we were stuck without reservations for dinner.  The staff graciously fit us in at Meritage, despite the fact that it was completely full. Often a restaurant will hem and haw and act as if it's an inconvenience before they finally fit you in. Not here. You would have thought they had been expecting us all day they were so welcoming. It was one of the most memorable dining experiences we've had.  Everything was top notch!  The staff at the hotel is well-trained and catered to our every need. The valets immediately caught on that I drink a lot of water and handed me a bottle each time as I walked in and out of the hotel from a run or walk around the city.  For lunch the next day I had a quick cup of clam chowder at the bar..one of the best I've ever had!The downside: The spa. Huge disappointment! Not at all what one would expect from a hotel that is so superior in every other area.  After changing into a robe you sit in a main lobby area where people of both genders are walking in and out to the gym. No one offered me water or tea or even apology.  I waited almost 25 minutes for my service as they were running late. And the facial I received was sub-par. They use great products but the esthetician seemed as if she were still in training. I understand most people don't go there for the ""spa experience"" but it seems like it was something they added on b/c they had a few extra rooms near the gym.

I was expecting more people at check in but there was no line and we were served immediately. Check in took all of 2 mins and we were off to our room. I had called ahead and requested a crib for our room. At check-in I was told the room was ready and the crib was already in place. The bellman was very friendly and recommended many places that we could go visit as a family. Once we got to the room it was very nicely appointed. We had a deluxe room which was great because it gave us a bit more space for our little one to run around. The crib was already setup with Winnie the pooh blankets and sheets as well a side bumper pads. It was perfect. The room was very clean. We had a king bed that was comfortable. We were not that high up (8th floor) but the city view was nice none the less. One small problem did occur as our toilet did not flush. I called the main desk and someone was up to our room in 5 mins to fix it. It only took about 10 mins to fix and after that there were no other problems. We also took advantage of the indoor pool. We took our little one down for a swim both days that we were there. The staff was very helpful and extremely nice to talk with. The pool was a little bit on the cool side when you jumped in but after a few minutes you were fine. The locker rooms and fitness facilities were also second to none for a hotel. The location is excellent. We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go. The Children’s museum was only about a 15 min walk away, the aquarium maybe 10 mins. We usually decided to go up to the North end to eat, as the restaurants up there are great. That is about a 15 minute walk also.

It also offers unusually spacious, elegant rooms with terrific views of the city or Boston harbor.  The hotel's location is conveniently close to Quincy market, Boston City Hall, the great restaurants of the North End, the Aquarium, and the site of the Boston Tea Party.  Service was efficient, but gracious from checking in to checking out.  As for the small but important, distinguishing courtesies, one of the bellman, Sergio, was particularly helpful in volunteering to show a member of our party who walks with a cane to the ramp leading up to the mezzanine, so she wouldn't have to navigate even a small number of steps.  Later, when we were checking out, he offered to bring our bags to the underground garage, saving us from having to load the car outside on a brisk morning.

155972254,89575,60745,Luxury and comfort close to the emerging Boston neighborhoods,"A recent weekend stay at the Boston Harbor Hotel proved to be even more enjoyable than we anticipated.  Upon arriving we got the pleasant surprise of being upgraded to a larger suite on the 16th floor with incredible Harbor views. The two room suite was large, spacious and clean (though the televisions were a bit dated). The bedding was comfortable, the bathroom large and clean. The views were nothing short of spectacular, allowing us to see far across the harbor in every direction. The staff was helpful without being overbearing, pointing us in the right direction as we ventured out on foot (full disclosure: we live in Mass and know Boston well, but it's helpful to confirm the best way to get somewhere I find). If you have been to Boston before but always found yourself in the usual spots (Back Bay, Kenmore, Newburyport Street, Beacon Hill), the Harbor is well situated to explore some new areas. It is a short walk to the emerging Seaport area, which, with its open walkways along the water and great new restaurants feels more like San Francisco than Boston. It is also a short walk in the other direction to the North End and the Quincy Market area, both of which are much more accessible and pleasant than in the past since I93 has been moved underground. If you haven't explored this part of Boston in a while, you'll be surprised at the change. The hotel includes, at the moment, a great exhibit of old maps of New England, well worth a few minutes if you are even a bit interested in the regions history. The Meritage Restaurant features an adventurous menu paired with carefully slelected wines, the chef is one of the founders of the Boston Wine Festival. The dark paneled bar inside the lobby is not to be missed, either, it's a great little hideaway for a romantic drink.The hotel's huge spa and gym area also features a four lane lap pool, a large jet tub (that was cranked up a little too hot), and a large gym much better equipped than what you typically find. They also offer spa services, but we didn't take advantage of any of that (not our thing). The Harbor is certainly not the cheapest hotel in town but it's also not quite as expensive as you might guess. If you are looking for a romantic weekend for two, it should definitely be on your list.

158693913,89575,60745,All expectations met.,"This is a very, very nice hotel.  Like most fine hotels, the service provided by the staff and the way you are treated is top notch.  The rooms are large, clean, and very comfortable.  The best of Boston is within walking distance.  Definitely consider this place!  My one small gripe about this place is that there isn't coffee makers in the rooms, nor is coffee available in the lobby.  There's a Starbucks to open soon downstairs, but I really want a cup in my room before venturing out and to have to order a $15.00 pot of coffee as the only option was a bummer.  Another hint/tip:  I don't mind paying for valet parking in the city, but self parking in this hotel couldn't be easier, and if you self park, you never have to step outside as the garage has an elevator that leads directly into the lobby of the hotel.  This is a huge bonus in the winter, especially if you have luggage.",0,"April 24, 2013", April 2013,50,NA,40,40,50,40,40,50,UID_DCDD5E4B1925254A47975F1BC020C65A-SRC_158693913,"South Portland, Maine",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonnyqball,58,32,"70 Rowes Wharf, Boston, MA 02110-3354"

159154629,89575,60745,"Comfortable, convenient, good service; wish could aware 4.5.","This is a very nice hotel, with remarkable water and city views, tastefully and conveniently appointed rooms and comfortable beds.  It occupies a prime location on the water, in the financial district, near tourist sites, taxis and public transport, and there is ample self-parking in addition to the valet option.  It also has possibly the nicest elevators I’ve seen in a hotel.  It offers all the useful amenities, such as a well-equipped fitness center, wifi at no additional charge (no ""nickel-and-dime""ing here) and 24/7 room service.  The staff, from the reception desk to the concierge to housekeeping and room service, are very friendly, competent and efficient.  The only oddity we encountered was the front door staff, which keeps me from giving 5 stars.  4.5 would be appropriate.  The front door staff were, without exception, friendly and cheerful.  However, we often felt invisible when approaching the hotel or leaving it.  At times, up to 3 uniformed individuals would be standing around chatting while let ourselves in and out, and we were asked by the same gentleman each time we pulled our (distinctive) car up for valet parking whether we were checking in.  We once had to go into the lobby to find someone to valet the car arriving back around 11 PM on weeknight.  Now, of course we are not spoiled to the extent that we can’t open our own doors, we didn’t take it personally that we were never recognized, and we were able to track down a valet when we needed one.  None of this will keep us from coming back.  But, I mention it because the service level at the doors distinguished itself poorly from that of other hotels at a similar price and service level, where I’ve always been baffled by how quickly the staff get to know guests’ names and habits, and where even if the valet is busy someone is around to let us know a valet is coming back. The only other thing I’d mention is that our room was behind the elevators and we could hear a mechanical noise, which was somewhat disguised by loud bathroom fan that ran 24/7.  This was not a problem for us, but if you are sensitive to such noises you may want to ask for a room away from the elevators.  All in all, we were very comfortable during our stay and will be back.",0,"April 29, 2013", April 2013,40,NA,50,50,50,50,50,40,UID_ED2B1DB715EFF674907558B8FDB05B11-SRC_159154629,New York,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Heather086,141,81,"70 Rowes Wharf, Boston, MA 02110-3354"
159161146,89575,60745,A remarkable weekend,"My wife and I had a wonderful 3 day stay at this hotel on the weekend of April 19-21. We had planned this as a 49th wedding anniversary celebration for several months and were looking forward to seeing a Boston Bruins hockey game on Friday night. Before we arrived, there was a mix-up in our reservation made through a third party but Jeannette in reservations at Bar Harbor took care of it promptly and professionally. When we arrived on Friday, the city was in lockdown because of the horrific events of the Boston Marathon. The management and staff of the hotel could not have tried any harder to make sure we had a great experience in spite of what was happening in the city. When the Bruins game was cancelled Friday night, we decided to have dinner in our room as travel in the city was still confined. We had already been surprised with complimentary bottle of champagne and a plate of treats from management. Room service was excellent. Our servers set up a table for two in our room at the huge bay window overlooking the harbor and Logan airport. We were impressed enough that we asked for the same service on Sunday night. It was even more enjoyable as the planes were flying (unlike Friday night) and the lights of the harbor and Logan airport provided a picturesque setting and added to another great dinner.Breakfast at this hotel is as good as it gets. Whether buffet style (Saturday, Sunday) or menu order (Monday), the food is top quality, well prepared and served by attentive and caring people. From front desk to concierge, housekeeping, door men and servers and greeters in the restaurants, the staff here knows the reason you picked their hotel to stay at and they go out of their way to make sure you have good reason to come back.

I am usually a mid-price hotel traveler, but since there are few such options located downtown, I decided to step up to the Boston Harbor.  It exceeded my expectations in every way.  The staff was extraordinarily helpful, from the concierge who recommended a nearby (i.e., walking distance) restaurant for a business dinner, to the front desk staff, to the attendants in the lower level fitness facility.  The fitness facility was large and well-equipped, and the hotel's location makes it perfect for a beautiful run along the harbor (weather permitting, of course).  The property itself is gorgeous and well-maintained.  I stayed in a Cityview Superior Room with king bed located on the 10th floor.

I was concerned because I booked late I wouldn't be able to get a smoking room, but it was no problem. Our room had wrap-around windows of the harbor and the city, and it was simple huge! I booked the superior room, but I think it was the deluxe due to the size. The B and B package included valet parking, breakfast (in-room or at Intrigue) and late check-out. To me, its the combo of classic, modern and great views with superior service which wins. The view was awesome, just like the hotels website shows. A great view over the harbor, towards the airport, so a nerd like me with my laptop could ID which planes where taking off at the exact time. My fiancee really liked the comfy bed, and she was most impressed when I went out to the store she called guest services and asked where the ice machine was! Turns out its complimentary, and when the room service attendant arrived, they brought her chocolates and strawberries as a ""i'm sorry"" gift because she wandered the hall for 10 minutes looking for the ice machine. We went out for a while, then returned and found our room refreshed for turndown. They actually hung my pants and shirt! I was impressed. We ordered room service pizza which arrived in 22 minutes, exactly 10 minutes earlier than stated. It was really good. In the morning, we had breakfast at the restaurant, mainly avoiding room service because my fiancee wanted pancakes. The buffet was decent, a little lacking in service, however, I thought the food was above average. She was a little disappointed that there were no pancakes available, but she lived! Coffee was ok, not great which you would expect, but thats personal taste. The service here is amazing. Yes, it beats the only FS I've stayed at. I came downstairs looking for the coffee place, and the second I had a puzzled look on my face, two guest services people jumped on me and asked ""sir, may I be of assistance"".

We were driving from Toronto with our toddler daughter and were running ahead of schedule. I called the hotel en route and asked if we could extend our reservation by a day, arriving later that evening. This was no problem...I was also assured that the crib I had requested would be ready in the room. We were superbly impressed with our City View King room. Beautiful furnishings, mellow lighting, two televisions, big comfortable bed.We needed a spot to keep a supply of ""kid-food."" I asked about storing things in the mini-bar, but was told this was not possible, instead I was offered a small fridge for the room for the duration of our stay. The twice daily housekeeping was a delight. It was so nice to return to our room at the end of a day of sightseeing to find fresh flowers, the curtains drawn, bottled water, ice bucket filled, classical music on the radio, and a bed ready to climb into. My daughter (who just turned two) kept remarking on the men who opened the doors for her (entering the hotel). The concierge was helpful in recommending child-friendly (yet, adult acceptable!) restaurants in walking distance to the hotel.I'm very particular about NOISE in hotels. We had no problem during our stay. We rarely heard other guests, and heard no noise from outside. The windows are incredibly soundproof.We were worried that the BHH would be a bit out of the way of the sights. As it turned out, it was a perfect location. We often popped back to the hotel mid-day for a nap. It was a short walk to the aquarium, and directly adjacent to some cool kid-friendly features within the Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway (we listened to jazz on the grass, and played in the fountain down the street).

168332939,89575,60745,Had a good stay at this hotel,"This was my first stay at the BHH. I picked this hotel based on good reviews, and looking on the map it seemed to be perfectly located even though I was attending a congress at the Boston Conference Center (a 20-minute walk). Following suggestions from other reviewers, I took the Rowes Wharf water taxi from Logan airport to the hotel. That couldn’t work better; I hopped on bus #66 and phoned to make a reservation, so when I arrived at the water transportation dock the water taxi was already waiting for me and for $10 provided a pleasant ride across the harbor straight to the BHH. The check-in was quick and courteous. My Harbor View King room was everything I asked for; a nice corner room away from elevators, with a great view of the harbor on one side and city on the other. It had a separate work area with a desk. The desk had built in power outlets and all the stationary and materials/info that one needs. There was also a safe in the room, large enough to fit a laptop. I loved the nightly turn down service, and on the first night they also left in my room a fruit plate and bottled water. It would be nice if on the remaining nights they left at least a pillow treat. Anyway it was great walking into a room that was refreshed, with classical music playing on the Bose radio. The bed was very comfortable, the AC worked fine, the windows were large and soundproof. The bathroom was spacious and the shower was great – good shower head, nice water pressure, curved shower curtain rod providing extra space, very nice. Also, great bath robe and slippers. The hotel has an excellent business center. The elevators worked great, I never had to wait, and the concierge/bellman staff was excellent.I also liked the location of this hotel. It is very close (5 minute walk) to subway, tourist buses, the aquarium, the waterfront areas and cruise ships, and Columbus park. It is also a walking distance to the North End area with many good restaurants. At the hotel I ate only at the Rowes Wharf Sea Grille and I don’t recommend this place; the ambient is OK but food and service were not good. It made more sense to try some of the real restaurants in the neighborhood. Davide and Bricco had good food. Bricco has a nice wood-burning oven and they bake bread in their own bakery just behind the restaurant. Mike’s Pastry shop has amazing cannoli.There were some problems. The drain in the sink and particularly the bathtub was clogged so in the shower you find yourself very quickly standing in a pond of water. I called the housekeeping about the bathtub drain and they fixed the problem quickly and efficiently. While the windows were soundproof, the walls were not, and I could hear TV from the neighboring room, but luckily that was only on the first night, they didn’t stay up too late and the remaining days/nights I didn’t hear any noise. Hotel security was very prominent in the lobby and near elevators, nothing wrong with that except those guys looked nasty; I guess they are not supposed to be friendly but at least they could smile or nod when encountering the guests of the hotel. One morning I found a note slipped under the door, informing the guests that hotel started cleaning the exterior of the windows and advising the guests to keep their window curtains closed during that week. I found this very inappropriate considering that I paid extra for a nice view. I contacted the front desk; they apologized for the inconvenience but said how they “can’t plan” for this type of a maintenance. I think that they have a serious problem if they can’t plan, and if window curtains need to be drawn close for a week then during that time the hotel should not charge extra for a better view which their guests won’t be able to enjoy.Overall I had a good stay at the BHH and will come back. I recommend it highly.",0,"July 20, 2013", July 2013,40,NA,50,40,40,50,40,40,UID_2BB4F706D36D49C72C860E92FB1C11DD-SRC_168332939,"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gazda,11,34,"70 Rowes Wharf, Boston, MA 02110-3354"

Our room was perfect for my wife and I and our daughter--she had her own ""pad"" in the sitting room area, which included a very comfortable pull out bed/sofa thingy.  The bathroom was plenty big, and there were nice quality (Asprey) stuff in there.  Lots of great towels, bathrobes, and slippers, too.Now, and I will write this as a POSITIVE, stuff happens sometimes in a hotel.  It's how the staff handles it that matters.  One morning, we noticed water around the floor of the toilet.  Called down, they asked us when we were taking off for the morning, and when we returned it was fixed.  Then, around 10pm at night the next day, there was water streaming onto the floor from under the sink.  Called down to housekeeping, and someone (a very competent someone) was there within 5 minutes.  Took the panel off, found the problem in the u thingy under the sink, and had it fixed within 10 minutes.  Cleaned up, gave us a new floor mat, and off he went.  Some people might come unglued over stuff like this, but we judge a hotel on how quickly they take of problems once they are reported.  Boston Harbor does great in our book.The Concierge staff is always so nice, and easy to work with--we wanted to take the day ferry to P-Town and take Art's Dune Tours.  Called Molly, and a little later the reservation letter appeared under our door.  Rob and the other guys are great with suggestions and directions, too.  My wife enjoyed an evening swim in the pool followed by a sauna visit--totally refreshing and relaxing.  As was the entire stay. When we came in for the evening, the girls at the hostess station in the restaurant got us cups of tea and coffee.  No charge.  While they have this available in the morning as you leave the breakfast room, we would like to see this available all the time, so we wouldn't have to bother the girls.  But, we understand with the hundreds of people coming in and out of the patio in the evening, this would be hard to do.How much do we love this place?  We brought the front desk and Concierge Staff cookies from Modern Pastry after visiting the North End!  The next morning, several of the staff thanked us!  Can't wait to return for a third visit!",0,"August 6, 2013", July 2013,50,NA,50,50,50,50,50,50,UID_B4699CE1B6A8E5EEF48551C465CD3AA2-SRC_171061450,"Salem, Massachusetts",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/runnrdad,75,31,"70 Rowes Wharf, Boston, MA 02110-3354"

We paid for a harbour view the first time around, but second time we got upgraded to a suite that had a small balcony giving not only harbour but city views too.We ate in both restaurants & also out on the patio to enjoy part of the 'summer in the city' events the hotel was hosting. Watching ET on a huge outdoor screen, sipping cocktails with the harbour view was a real experience. The more formal Meritage restaurant is where we ate for the celebration meal. The staff looked after us well, with good suggestions all around & made us feel special. We especially liked the simplicity of the menu style - food was grouped together by how it would go with certain wine styles e.g light, fruity reds or full bodied reds. You then knew that if you picked something from this category you could look at the similarly styled wine list to make a reliable choice if you weren't over confident on selecting your own. Also, the 2 pricing options - small or large plates were priced accordingly, so you could either have 1 small & 1 large, or 3 small dishes to get more variety. Really good ingredients, put together elegantly resulted in really the best food we ate all holiday.The spa was also great - we both used the pool & sauna / steam facilities, but my husband had a massage.

Thanks to the housekeeper our room was immaculately clean and we appreciated that in the evening our bed was turned down, a small bottle of water left by the bedside, bedroom slippers laid out for our use and wet towels were replaced. Small gestures such as these go a long way to making guests such as ourselves very comfortable throughout our stay and this is a hotel that we would certainly recommend without hesitation to friends who may be visiting Boston.

We (a group of 4) had booked a table with window seating for 7.30.  A note under our door asked us if we would mind moving it to 8 which we did.  On arrival we were sat at the rear of the restaurant with the explanation that someone in senior management would be having the window table.  The meal was terribly slow and painful, perhaps the staff were in a tizz from whomever this person was.  All I know is that we were fully paying customers who had booked.

If there is a phone, there might arise a need at some point of time to jot down some info. Housekeeping was flawless. Both in the morning as well as the evening turn down service.  They would place a glass of milk with some cookies every evening for my toddler. Room service was fabulous. Quick. Great food. Staff so warm and friendly. The concierge desk was super efficient. Hotel’s location was great for us. Children’s Museum, Aquarium, Little Italy, Faneuil Hall, Chinatown – are all walking distance. There is a Starbucks right next to the hotel and an Italian restaurant called Pasta Beach which serves great food. So plenty of places to eat, shop or visit.

It was stunningly beautiful a view day and night.  The room has a more traditional decor, but nothing says cutting corner or leftovers but a deliberate style pursuit.  When I noticed that all linens and sheets were from Frette, I knew they have invested in comfort and luxury.  I ordered one room service dinner after a late night arrival. The crabmeat salad was very delicious, and reasonably priced.  I couldn't say the same about oatmeal in the morning though.Other than that, the staff were absolutely wonderful and delightful and it was in this hotel where I was introduced to this very special dessert wine called rosa regale.

We were looking forward to a wonderful multi-night stay during our trip to Boston, but when we tried to check in at 9:30pm, the manager came out to tell us that they were overbooked and there was no room for us there.  GRRRR!  Now, if I was traveling by myself, I would have been mildly irritated, but I had my spouse and 3-year old in tow and this did not go over well.  On top of that, there was a terrific thunderstorm going on at the time and we had to navigate through unfamiliar streets in the dark during pouring rain.  The BHH found us a room a few miles away, in a very inconvenient location for our sight-seeing purposes.  Managment of the BHH said that this rarely happens, but the desk clerk at the replacement hotel said that it does indeed happen with the BHH with regularity.Another couple checked in after we started to walk away from the front desk of the BHH and were given a room key.  At this point I was irate.  The BHH desk clerk told me that the couple was part of a wedding party who had a guarantee on their rooms.  Well, I had given a credit card number when I booked my room as well.  Had I not showed up, my card would have been charged anyway.  How is that not a guarantee on my end?  My only guess is that because I got a very good rate via the BHH website, the hotel decided that I was a good candidate to give the boot to, in favor of a guest who was paying more $$.I've never been denied a room at a hotel before, whether the Ritz or Holiday Inn.  If the BHH had decided to put me up in a comparable hotel, I'd probably be less perturbed, but as it is I am livid and would never, never try to stay there again.Since it appears to be a regular policy of the BHH to conduct themselves in this manner, then Traveler Beware!!!",0,"July 18, 2008", July 2008,10,NA,NA,10,NA,40,NA,NA,UID_F64FCED4341F9C9A6D527141AC9A335B-SRC_18025464,San Diego,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaJollaTraveler,2,23,"70 Rowes Wharf, Boston, MA 02110-3354"

181826135,89575,60745,Great for a staycation too!,"First, the bad (starting off with this as there is really only one flaw with the hotel) - the suite is nothing to write home about considering its name and price tag. This is the Harbor corner suite which in reality is a largish room (with no separate living room), plain decor, and basic toiletries. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being so-unbelievably-plush-you-don't-want-to-emerge decor/bathroom/toiletries, this will probably be a 5.5. (eg, Raffles Hotel in Singapore will land somewhere between 8 and 9 on said scale).But that aside, the view (the sunrise was a giant ball of orange fire) was breathtaking. Apart from the sunrise, our room on the 10th floor overlooks the dome-shaped restaurant abutting the waterfront, and the view was one of still sparking water, and tranquil little white boats moored in the middle of the bay(?). We could see planes landing and taking off from Logan Airport, but the Airport was too far for any of the noise to reach us.

We had breakfast in the Sea Grill restaurant. It was pricey but pretty good. All American fare but without the arteries-bursting calories.For me, that extra X factor was not its location or the food. It was the service. I think it is a pretty good sign a hotel chooses to place framed pictures of its employees in all the strategic places (hallway, corridor, outside the hotel). It (hopefully) says that it treats them well and puts a premium on service. It certainly feels that way during our stay. Other than having everyone greet you by name, everyone we have approached for help (room service, concierge, restaurant staff, front desk, housekeeping) was impeccable.

182503262,89575,60745,Have previous reviewers ever stayed in a 'real' 5-Star hotel??,"Check out my other reviews - global traveller with over 150 night a year in hotels across the globe.I was actually looking forward to a stay at the Boston Harbor, mostly because I put a lot of faith into all my fellow TripAdvisor Reviewers…but clearly none of you have experienced genuinely 5-star hotels judging by the reviews.So, the hotel is not in the best location - as a tourist you want to be by the Common, not by a soulless harbor (there are no shops or restaurants on the strip of harborside by the hotel) on one side and a dead financial centre on the other - although to be fair, Boston is a small place and everything is a 15-20 mins walk.Its also a little odd, kind of lop-sided with the entrance to the side and the hotel flopping over a pointless archway to the harbour behind. There are very limited public spaces and it looks like a popular destination for weddings/corporate events (always a bad sign).This is simply NOT a luxury hotel, nothing like a good Ritz Carlton or Four Seasons, yet it charges the same. The rooms are chintzy and dated, and its no surprise that most of the other guests I saw were 60+. There is a good range of amenities and technology (good free WiFi), but thats about it. As others have said, one of the biggest issues (a personal bug-bear) is the total absence of any insulation between rooms or corridors. I heard an entire conversation from next door about the flight in from Dallas, and the noise in the corridors is amplified by the silly long marble corridors to the rooms - at times its deafening, like when the turn down service is in the corridor - the noise of the Ice being decanted is like a tropical storm outside your room door. I had banging from the room above too and asked to move. They found me another room, a floor lower (8th) but no apology or nice touch like a room upgrade for a broken night's sleep.The new room was even worse, despite only having one set of neighbours, but they had the TV on all night and again, I could hear every pitch of the World Series. The walls are paper-thin.I went to flush the toilet in the new room and I had a broken cistern, with water cascading all over the floor. Again, another call to the front desk - and no apology, just a 'we will send someone up'. No offer to move room (having had waste water flood the bathroom). More Motel 6 than 5-Star hotel.There really is no customer focus at this place. When I approached the check-in desk she picked up the phone and everyone looks like they are going through the motions. All perfectly acceptable for a 3-4 star hotel - but its the attention to the guest and the little details that matter (like cutting back the weeds growing outside my window).I walked past the better located, better priced and better serviced Ritz Carlton later that day, and regretted trying something 'off-brand'. Never again and never here.",0,"October 26, 2013", October 2013,20,NA,10,10,30,20,40,10,UID_6ED6B8C8F5075040A202722706D23E3B-SRC_182503262,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/milesw,139,550,"70 Rowes Wharf, Boston, MA 02110-3354"

We had a water front room both times and the sunrises over Logan airport across the harbor are spectacular. Service at every station in this hotel is excellent. Name recognition of guests is obviously a priority for the employees. They make you feel important.A recent review here complained about the hallway noise and this is the only thing we can agree with the reviewer on. There was a wedding party the day we arrived and our room was close to the elevator. When the party broke up (around 5 in the afternoon), it was extremely noisy for about 15 minutes. No problem at any other time.The location here is excellent and we were able to walk downtown in about 20 minutes with lots of shops and restaurants along the way.

18584169,89575,60745,No longer a 5 star hotel,"We had stayed here a few years ago and really thought it was a beautiful hotel.  So, based on our previous experience, we decided we would stop over for two nights at the hotel before making our way to Cape Cod.  The hotel is in a good location, but looks as if management is cutting corners.  The hotel gets a great deal of traffic, and it shows. The room used for the breakfast buffet and evening cocktails is a bit shabby, overcrowded, and not that clean.  Worst of all, and to our dismay, the hotel is ""pet friendly"".  Pets can be quite wonderful (we have our own), but please leave them at home! We booked two rooms for two nights (over $1,000 per night).  One room smelled like a cat had been in it, and neglected to use the cat box!  The other room had pet hair on the bed and all over the carpet!   I do give the hotel credit for being responsive.  We were given a small suite to replace the horrible smelling first room, and the room with pet hair was eventually better cleaned and clothes that had picked up pet hair were laundered by the hotel at no charge to us. But, it took a day and half before anyone at the hotel even admitted that it was ""pet friendly""!  We just kept thinking how strange it was that someone had an animal in their room!  Really, is that what anyone expects from a so called five-star hotel?  We spent so much time when we first checked in dealing with problems, that the entire stay was really ruined.  Again, when we complained, the staff was helpful, but not what I would call overly apologetic for such unacceptable conditions.This hotel clearly is banking on the fact that its location on the harbor is enough to compensate for its shortcomings.

185989745,89575,60745,Good apart from the Pile Driver!,"This was our first trip to Boston and we stayed for 4 nights, we chose the hotel because of the good reviews, we arrived from the airport by water taxi which was inexpensive and a good start. On arriving at the hotel we were greeted by the doormen who were always cheerful and welcoming. Check in was swift, but we weren't given any information about where anything was or facilities available, we booked a harbour view room and were on the 8th floor, which sounds fine but was the first stop of the lift and we overlooked a roof, albeit with a water view. In hindsight I would not have paid the several hundred pounds extra for the harbour view as we didn't spend much time in the room, OR, I would ask for a much higher floor.The room itself was lovely, the bed comfortable and bathroom and accessories etc were fine, however, apart from Sunday we were woken early by the incessant and constant pile driver noise from work being undertaken somewhere nearby, you couldn't get back to sleep it was constant and extremely irritating. The other REAL disappointment was that there were no tea/coffee making facilities in the room although you could order room service, I think something like $12 or $14 for coffee (plus tip), and while I appreciate that this is a high quality hotel, I like to be able to make a cup of tea/coffee when I want it, not to have to phone/wait/greet/tip etc, especially when you're in a bad mood because of the pile driver.The Hotel is lovely inside but we didn't use any of the facilities, and if you want breakfast in the hotel I would book it in advance as part of a package as it seemed quite expensive, we actually enjoyed eating out every day.We took a tour initially which was a good orientation and in terms of the hotel location, it's fine for the waterside and North end but if we come back to Boston which is an extremely friendly city with lovely areas and really helpful locals, we would probably stay nearer the common or Copley area, and the underground system is easy to negotiate.Checkout again was fine but no-one asked us whether we enjoyed our stay or invited any comments.Would I recommend the Hotel? --I think in spring or summer I would, I'm not so sure in the winter, and I would definitely find out if there was any major construction work nearby as one of the tour guides said that there were some major plans in the Seaport area for more hotels/conference/exhibition centres etc  which is quite close to the Hotel.",0,"November 26, 2013", November 2013,40,NA,30,30,40,40,50,30,UID_B985BC47295F7FFC0F46D55F627F92F6-SRC_185989745,"Carmarthen, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sunflowerWales,88,86,"70 Rowes Wharf, Boston, MA 02110-3354"

It was perfect for our 5 day trip.  First, let me praise each and every staff member we encountered.  From the informative reservation person to the friendly doormen (Jimmy always went out of his way to give us directions and tips to the best lobster rolls in town), professional front desk clerks (who made special room requests easy), to the extremely conscientious Concierge team (Miller, Rob) and the hotel drivers, Rafik and Anthony were always a step ahead of our needs.  The hotel housekeeping staff are excellent and always friendly.  Cookies and milk were brought each night for our son, and one night we arrived to a lovely surprise of wine and a cheese and fruit platter.  One night we decided to try and get last minute tickets to a show and couldn't obtain them on our own, so Miller at the Concierge desk made some calls and ""walla"" he found us great seats at an almost sold-out show.  When we arrived at the Boston Harbor Hotel after a long and tiring red-eye flight the hotel made every effort to get us into our room before 10:00 AM even though we had made special room requests.  They simply made it perfect.  The room was large, decorated in classic New England fashion, spotless and laid out in a comfortable floor plan with a sofa bed in a separate area.

There is a hot whirlpool tub in there too.Their restaurant has very good breakfast; we tried both buffet and a la carte. Buffet selection was very satisfying, with hot foods, berries, hot cereals, smoked fish and many different pastries. As to the dinner, we liked it so much that ended up dining there 3 nights in a row until we tried all the selection of their seafood, which was absolutely delicious. Desserts were very nice and creative, too. And the service is superb.Also, valet service needs to be praised for fast and smooth operation.

Short taxi ride from airport to Hotel, and was received professionally, and courteously.  Doors were held for me, and I was swiftly escorted to the front desk, and finally to my simi suite-sized accommodations.  Front desk was thorough and swift.  Room was very impressive upon entrance.  Well serviced and clean.  Big pet peeve of mine is ice bucket liners...they don't have them.  I wish all hotels would use them, with the things people do in hotel rooms these days.  I had to spend a little time adjusting the hvac vents to make sure warm air was evenly distributed throughout the space, as the bathroom area was exceedingly cold.  The vents could have been better cleaned.  Big gripe turned out to be cable TV support.  cable service was out too much of the time...snowy, frigid weather made it appealing to hang around the hotel, but, you could not count on the TV working for pretty much the entire time I was there.  This is very disappointing.  Then, on Saturday, the elevators went out, too!!!  This was for approximately 1 hour--sat in the lobby and talked to other guests...turned out to be pleasant.  Restaurants and bar were def adequate, but, I did not find extravagant in any form or fashion....just solid.  The more casual restaurant closed for renovations while I was there, but, I got the chance to have one meal there.

19832233,89575,60745,"Wonderful view, wonderful place, wonderful people!","I live in upstate NY and decided to get away for a couple of days over the Labor Day weekend. We wanted to stay someplace on the ocean and we have two dogs, and found it's really hard to find someplace right on the beach that pets are allowed. So we decided to look at Boston because it's on the ocean and we though we might take a ferry ride (we learned that the Harbor Cruises do allow pets on the sightseeing tours). I was going to stay at the Residence Inn Tudor Wharf, which as a Marriott rewards member I knew would be consistent and good as usual. But it appeared to be a bit more on the river, and since we usually order take-out because of the dogs, we really wanted a room with the view.I had been searching hotels in Boston and kept coming back to the Boston Harbor Hotel, but wasn't sure I wanted to spend the money for it. When I looked at their web site, I couldn't help but call the hotel to see what they might have available. The night before we were going, I was fortunate enough to speak to Debbie, one of the managers, who was extremely helpful and was able to give me a great rate in a Harborview room. I decided then that I would pamper myself and my husband, because we had been working really hard lately! Was I ever glad I did!!!From the moment we arrived at the hotel, I would say SERVICE is the first word I could say about the hotel, and that word continued throughout our stay. I'm amazed at hotels like this where the people get to know your names, and even the names of our dogs as we took them in and out.  When we got into our room though, I heard my husband say ""Wow!"" as he looked at the view. We were on the 8th floor which had an amazing view of the harbor and we could see the ocean beyond. I felt as though I could just sit there looking! But there was one glitch - the room we were in didn't have windows that opened, and I knew that some did, even if every so slightly, and I wanted to be able to hear the sounds of the harbor! Never fear - I called the front desk and they said there was an identical room right next door, and they moved us immediately.  That night we ordered dinner from their more casual restaurant and my husband said it was the best clam chowder he ever had. I had also inquired about staying a third night with Debbie, and she sent me a nice note back saying she would extend the rate. She was working at night so I never did get to meet her, but based on our phone conversations and notes, I felt like I knew her, or at least I knew that she was taking care of us as a guest.The decor was beautiful, and the housekeeping staff was great as well as the bellhops, just everyone! We also both were able to use the pool, which is huge, and the whirlpool which was the best I was ever in (really hot and big). My husband also sprung for the deep tissue massage that was really something. It's so easy to get to the spa, you just take the elevator straight down without having to walk around the hotel in your swimsuit - that was a little plus I really liked.  Finally, the location is really nice.....very central to everything, including the wonderful new greenway that was marvelous for walking the dogs, but not as busy and crazy as the scene down by the Marriott LongWharf where we took the cruise. On the cruise I was able to see the location of the Residence Inn, and it looked very nice, but not like the view from the Boston Harbor Hotel.  Now I'm spoiled - if I ever go to Boston again, I'm going to want to splurge for this hotel!!! I can't recommend it enough.",0,"September 6, 2008", August 2008,50,NA,NA,40,50,50,50,50,UID_4131425145234EFF7D9323F46EA5F859-SRC_19832233,"Albany, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BB4th,71,101,"70 Rowes Wharf, Boston, MA 02110-3354"
198542046,89575,60745,A stunning view,"During a recent tour of the US we spent 3 nights here. We arrived in Boston on the Acela Express. The distance from Boston South Station to the hotel is walkable, if you are not carrying large amounts of luggage. Check in was efficient and easy. We had pre-paid for a Harborview Deluxe Room with king bed and that is exactly what they had for us. We were at the far north end of the hotel, which is a reasonable walk from the Lift to your room. The room was spacious and comfortable & the bed was good with no problems sleeping. The lounge area with its separate TV was large, with sufficient room to both curl up on the sofa and watch TV. The view from the room was outstanding, a superb vista across the bay, with the airport in the distance. One of the best hotel views we have had within a major city. The room was very clean and housekeeping did a good job keeping it tidy. We were a little disappointed to return one snowy cold day at 15:00 hours to find the room hadn’t been sorted. Strangely they didn’t have any way to indicate that they could service the room, which we normally hang out / switch on when we head out. Wireless was free but ultimately useless, signal was strong but you could only occasionally log in and would not be connected for long. Perhaps it is the room’s location in the building (as I said at the far north end) but given the signal was strong the intermittent issue would seem to lie elsewhere. Mentioned this to the hotel who said they would look into it but it wasn’t resolved by the time we left.Overall the staff were great, always helpful and polite. Concierge booked a show for us and made a number of very good recommendations regarding places to eat. We used the spa facilities, the pool was excellent and perfect for getting some lengths done.

We literally went door to door to see which hotel in the area would be safe for me - the Boston Harbor hotel was #5.

202163114,89575,60745,Does not get any better than this.,"This review focuses on singular merits which, when cobbled together, makes this hotel worth reviewing as a standout property.  I rate this a 5 out of 5.Room:Building is of solid construction, and evidently very well insulated. From a corner unit, we heard nothing from the adjacent unit. Undetectable overhead.  The windows, which opened, completely muted street noise. Spotless.  Even though carpeted, there was no evidence of soiling.  Frette linens in and out of bed.  Turn-down service with foot wipes in case one picked up crud between bathroom & bed.  Ample free bottled water.  Hi-Def TV channels with excellent signal quality, and fast free internet.Bathroom:Spotless.  Marbled throughout. Asprey toiletries.  Room Servicing:Discreet.  Will not get any better than this.  Room servicing - immaculate attention to detail.  Immediate room service response and delivery.  And we're not just talking in-room dining.  Telephone dials engaged those willing to accommodate any whim, in prompt order.Gym, pool, suana, hot-tub:In-room cotton gowns & slippers.  Generous sized gym lockers, and generous outlay of personnel hygiene/toiletries.  Steam-room that works as design intended.  Sauna in perfect working condition, albeit with dated wood paneled benches.  Heated lap-length pool.  Well designed communal hot-tub, with powerful jets.  Media room with wide selection of daily newspapers.Staff:This is where hotels ultimately make it, or break it.  Investment in personal is glaringly obvious.  This place is THE business as evidenced by the valet, front door, front desk, room servicing, restaurant waiters, elevator attendees.  Staff training is not a work in progress.  It's fait accompli.  As such, I imagine this place has no need to troll tripadvisor reviews.  Personal are discreetly proactive, with fingers on the pulse, clearly in anticipation of balanced presences.  Congratulations to management for motivating the staff.Cons:There is a coffee/tea/orange juice/water station in the spa/gym/pool area.  Excellent quality teas, good selection, honey and lemon. It was gone in the afternoon when I needed to soothe & coat my throat.  On my next stay, I may suggest servicing the station into the evening.",0,"April 21, 2014", March 2014,50,NA,50,50,50,30,50,50,UID_C4DF50B2ACF6A9CF6BBBC5BCA8613D14-SRC_202163114,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kranshoek,1,3,"70 Rowes Wharf, Boston, MA 02110-3354"

It was a fantastic hotel with a lovely view of the Boston Harbor. I'm a nutty clean freak in hotels.

Service was impeccable all around without being overbearing. Room service breakfast was tasty and prompt. All that having been said, I wouldn't have stayed there if it had been my choice.

Also, I felt oddly underdressed in my yoga pants, hoodie and baseball hat in the lobby on my way out for a walk, as if my attire wasn't up to snuff for the blue bloods congregating outside the elevators.  My husband and I hit the bar on a Wednesday night in what I felt was appropriate ""bar attire""... dressy jeans and trendy heals, nice cardigan, etc, and I felt out of place both in terms of my dress and my age (I'm 39). Next time I visit Boston I'll probably book something more central.

20766412,89575,60745,Wedding Night & Honeymoon Weekend Stay,"We stayed here on our wedding night in a suite. I preordered snacks for our room & a small breakfast for the next morning. We didn't get there till about 11:00pm, the valets/doormen are perfectly courteous & quick to open the doors. Front desk check in - very friendly & helpful. The room was nice - didn't blow me away, but very nice (it is Boston so one does have to spend a good chunk of change for an amazing room at a 5 star hotel). Turndown service had already happened & our snacks were laid out just as I had requested. I didn't know what they had for room service & the person I spoke with just asked what I wanted - so I asked for Spinach Artichoke Dip, which they provided without problem! We also had some truffles, sparkling & still water, chips, veggies & fruit. They also provide Figi water & ice with the nightly turndown service, however on our wedding night & the first night of our weekend stay, they neglected to give us water for both of us, however the 2nd night they did. They also set out slippers for you. The bathroom is decent, & I did appreciate the sewing kit, Shout detergent packet & mini Woolite Packet which I actually used!  The towels were a bit rough. Our morning roomservice came right on time & looked very presentable. The NEXT weekend, we stayed there again in a smaller room - but we actually liked it better b/c it had a view of the harbor and the city! it was gorgeous. Everyone was nice. We ate at Meritage for dinner, felt a bit underdressed but the food & service was great. Next day we booked massages - very nice & the pool & locker rooms are very nice, we even used the pool & jacuzzi & they even supply shorts & t-shirts for you to work out in, or for guys to use as swim trunks, plenty of towels, robes, slippers, combs etc etc We booked the ""bed & breakfast"" package which included valet parking & free breakfast at Intrigue - which was a very nice but standard breakfast buffet- but for the extra $40.00 per night - TOTALLY worth it. Before our massages I was able to convince my new husband to book another night, we did & got to keep the same room and the next day at checkout the same girl was there & recognized us.This is definitely the nicest hotel I have stayed in, we don't mind splurging for our wedding & plan to go back for our anniversary!",0,"October 9, 2008", October 2008,50,NA,NA,50,50,50,NA,50,UID_AADFE4E7544F73D6C6364B0E38BC14FF-SRC_20766412,Boston,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/,10,28,"70 Rowes Wharf, Boston, MA 02110-3354"

My husband called the hotel in advance to inform them of our special day and there was no acknowledgement from the staff or any treat delivered as I've read in many of the reviews here. My hubby sweetly ordered a bottle of wine and a fruit tray. The wine is delicious but the fruit tray consisted of a banana, an orange, two dried apricots and an apple with a huge bruise. The room is of good size and our daughter is using the sofa bed. The furnishings are lovely. She says the the sofa bed is just ""ok"" and a little hard. The tv reception has been spotty. A good portion of our evening has been with no service. I'm guessing trouble with the satellite?The bathroom is of good size. There is a sitting area with a large mirror. The shower was good with plenty of hot water. The toilet has been flushing on its own every hour or so and we will notify the front desk tomorrow morning. My main surprise is how thin the walls are. I can hear our neighbors conversation quite clearly and could hear everything that was going on in their bathroom from ours. Even conversations in the hallway are easily heard.

Unexpected weather issues brought me to Boston a day early. Although 95% committed, Daniel on the front desk was able to arrange an early arrival and managed to keep me in the same suite I had reserved for all 3 days. When I arrived (without luggage) at 2 am, Jimmy greeted me warmly and Josephine, not only streamlined my check in, but outfitted me with a complete set of complimentary toiletries and sundries so that I could make it through the morning. In moments, I was in a much needed, wonderful bed. Staff is uniformly perfect. Sergio in bell services, the entire room service staff (15-25 minutes tops for breakfast EVERY day) and all of the front desk ladies and gentlemen. They even provided my 9yr old daughter with complimentary cookies (nut free on their inquiry) and milk, and me with fresh fruit and all the bottled water you can muster, complimentary. Wi-Fi similarly requires no cumbersome registration and was also complimentary. You pay for your room, tax and parking, (a little pricey at 47.00 for valet, but your on the Boston Waterfront). No nickel and diming and I appreciate that. Room was terrific. Harbor view Rotunda Suite with a balcony. Expansive views across the heavily traveled harbor, and North city views across the Rotunda to Bunker Hill Monument and Quincy Market, which is a 5 minute stroll.

212029300,89575,60745,"Generally a very good hotel, but there is a noise problem","At daytime, we had a pleasant stay in room 1508 of this airport hotel. At nighttime there is a noise issue! While the hotel windows and walls are very well insulated to block outside noise (we did not hear airplanes taking off at all) noise from the hallway was terrible. There was no party going on, but there were simply guests talking while walking to their rooms. It felt like they were talking right next to our bed. I know it sounds like I am exaggerating, but it really woke us up numerous times. We also asked some guests who had a never ending conversation to stop talking in the middle of the night (apparently they attended the wedding that was taking place in the hotel). The reason for that noise is probably the space between the doors of all rooms (at least on floor 15) and their carpets. We told the very nice guy who checked us in about this. The hotel is aware of the problem and apparently there will be a major renovation taking place at the end of the year to address this issue. We were told that by the beginning of 2015 everything should be back to normal.If we had not experienced this noise issue we would highly recommend this hotel. Good facilities, great, very friendly and helpful staff and well equipped rooms with very comfortable beds. The location is not ideal for tourists wishing to explore the city, but there are water taxis across the harbour for 10 USD one way / 17.50 USD return rides which leave right in front of the hotel. The hotel's free shuttle bus will also drop you of at the subway station. One thing that also bugs me a little bit about his hotel (besides the noise issue)... We wanted to watch a video on demand one night as we could not be bothered about going out again after a long day of sightseeing... The hotel charges at least 14 USD excl. taxes for one movie. Some are even more expensive. Rediculous prices for movies in today's world that make you think they are just ripping you off.

212920956,89575,60745,Unpleasant experience but great management response,"This is a difficult review as, on the one hand, our hotel experience was so bad that we left after one night of a planned three-night stay to celebrate our wedding anniversary. On the other hand, hotel management rose to the occasion and did right by us - with many apologies - when we checked out.I'd give the hotel one or two stars tops for comfort, amenities, quiet, etc. We heard clunks, bangs, whirring noises, and something that sounded like someone dragging wrought-iron patio furniture across concrete above us at all hours of the day and night. At first we thought it might be housekeeping, but they don't clean rooms in the middle of the night (or shouldn't!). There were also traveling groups which had booked multiple rooms at least on our floor. So, there was constant talking and laughing in the hallway and doors banging closed - again, at all hours.Although we had booked a suite, and another popular travel site credits the Boston Harbor as having some of the biggest hotel rooms in Boston, ours was rather small and disappointing. There was a sort of slight shabbiness to the hotel, too - like it's a few years past due for a good overhaul. Elevators were banged up and sometimes dirty, hallways walls were marked up in spots, and our room furnishings showed their age. Also, little things - like no coffee maker in the room, and only a few available outlets for charging electronics - were irksome.Common areas were ""lively"", as there was at least one wedding underway, and as already mentioned, several groups apparently traveling together. I'd call the Boston Harbor a great place to have a bachelor/bachelorette weekend, a family reunion, or for groups traveling together. It is, after all, convenient to much of what there is to do and see in Boston. However, I'd call it a lousy place for a quiet, romantic getaway to celebrate an anniversary.Again, all that said, hotel management took our complaints seriously and treated us with respect and care when we checked out. I'd give that attitude five stars. So, while my opinion of the Boston Harbor as a place to stay isn't very high, it's good to know that management takes care of the guests. That's worth three stars overall any day. Stay there if you're in a big group and don't mind a lot of noise.

What a delight to wake each morning to the sun glistening on the water with view of the harbor, complete with a variety of  boats and planes taking off from Logan.  All of the hotel was very elegant and pristine.  I don't think the website did it justice.  And every person we came in contact with couldn't have been more helpful and friendly.  The concierge desk got us Red Sox tickets, offered many suggestions, and assisted with transportation. The location offered a great spot to walk everywhere, along with the South Station T just two blocks away.  We spent a lot of time just meandering along the harbor walk along the back of the hotel.  The area was quite lively on a Saturday night, but not too noisy, just fun.   We enjoyed a lunch and lite supper at the Sea Grill outside- fabulous food.  I am trying to replicate the crab salad.

Staying in the hotel 20 years later, my overwhelming reaction is that nothing has changed.  The hotel and rooms are exactly as I remember them - tasteful and perhaps a bit dated now.  Compared to many of the other hotels in this category, the Boston Harbor does not have any of the modern updates that are typical.  For example, my colleagues and I all staying in different rooms remarked in the morning how hard it was to find plugs to recharge our smartphones, IPads and laptops.  I unplugged a lamp under the desk, one of my friends crawled under the bed to find a power strip.  In this day and age, most hotels make these connections easy.  The luxury is also heavy - dark woods, heavy drapes, plush carpets.

Before we were seated, my sister, who is in a wheelchair, and I were looking for the accessible restroom.  We ended up in the service floor of the elevator in a business building next to the hotel.  While I was looking to see where we were, the doors closed and she went missing in the elevator.  A nicely dressed man came through the door and asked if I needed help.  I explained what happened and he offered to walk with me to the appropriate elevator.  My sister was still missing so he waited with me until she finally came back to the floor.  He then led us outside and walked with us through the hotel (pushing her up the ramp) until we came to the restroom.  I happened to mention that we were waiting for a table for awhile.  We weren't unhappy - we were a table of 5 so we knew it would be a long time - we were enjoying the music and being outside (the hostesses were doing a great job).  He offered to check on the table and he gave me an update.  He waited with me until I said I'd be fine in leading her back out to the restaurant.  When my sister came out, one of the service managers appeared to help us back outside.  I asked him what this kind, very helpful person did at the hotel and found out he's the General Manager (he had asked the service manager to help us).   When I said how helpful he had been, the service manager said that's what he's like - he's wonderful - very service oriented.  We had another incident in the parking garage and ended up meeting a waitress (?) on a couple of floors.  When I joked that something like this happened earlier and that Mr. Johnston had helped us - she also raved about him.

Among the hotels recommended were the Marriott at Long Wharf, Hilton Boston Downtown, and the Boston Harbor Hotel. Both reception and dinner were held at the Aquarium among sea lions and penguins -- a unique experience albeit we had attended countless weddings in our lifetime. We picked Boston Harbor Hotel by name, not knowing that the Aquarium was right at the Marriott's door steps. Little did we know that our luck began there. The Boston Harbor is located at Rowe's Wharf. Parking entrance on Purchase, which is easy. Entrance and exits to the Interstate are literally yards away. So are local attractions such as the Quincy Markets and Faneuil Hall. New to Boston's harbor redevelopment, we found the Rose Kennedy Greenway a terrific concept and a breath of fresh air in large American metropolitan areas. The hotel itself is impeccable, both in service and in decor. Facade of the building is red brick with a 2-story high arch. Restaurant is right on water's edge, We had a harbor view room giving us unobstructed view of ships coming and going. Despite its central location, the hotel is serene. Facilities are open and easy to locate. The Aquarium is a five minute leisure stroll away, along the wharves if one wishes. Chinatown is a 10 minutes walk on the Rose Kennedy connect adorned by well kept greenery and occasional art objects. The connect makes wharf hotels possible, and the Boston Harbor is easily among the best, and well worth its charge I must say.

236004750,89575,60745,A week in Boston,"Stayed here for five nights on our wedding anniversary in October 2014. We had a harbour view deluxe room, which was spacious and well equipped. We have stayed in Boston 4 times now and this was the best hotel so far.... the service was excellent - the staff very friendly we were spoilt  in the restaurant with excellent service and kind attention on our anniversary dinner. All staff were helpful and polite. The hotel had a layout that not even some of the staff could explain- but that did not matter we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and hope to go back some day. No tea or coffee facilities in the room was the only small down point - however there was a starbucks right next to the hotel so it didn't really matter. Loved it.",0,"October 24, 2014", October 2014,50,NA,NA,NA,NA,50,NA,50,UID_A74B22AC3848FB1DEF66BC164B6A577E-SRC_236004750,"Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Geoffman8,10,4,"70 Rowes Wharf, Boston, MA 02110-3354"
236360284,89575,60745,Loved it!,"After a week long coach trip round NH, VT and Maine followed by a few days driving round Cape Cod we were looking forward to a couple of days relaxing in Boston before jetting back to the UK.  Boston Harbor was booked on the strength of its Tripadvisor reviews.  Expensive but worth every single penny/cent.After a short taxi ride from the airport, where we'd dropped off our rental car, we were met by friendly helpful door staff.  Having arrived just before noon we were expecting to have to leave our luggage and wander around Boston until the room was ready.  'No problem' said the welcoming receptionist, 'I'll see if your room is ready yet'.  Within 5 minutes we were sitting with our feet up in the room and our luggage had been delivered for us.We'd opted for a deluxe harbour view room as we wanted a room where we could both sit comfortably.  So many hotels have one comfortable chair and expect the other person to sit in a desk chair or on the bed.  The sitting area had a sofa and magnificent views over the harbour towards the airport. Great for doing a bit of plane spotting or watching all the boat activity.  A multitude of ferries ply back and forth on a regular basis providing much better entertainment than TV!  Well worth the extra cost of the Harbor View.The room was immaculate, we felt like we were the first guests ever in there.  Everything seemed clean and new.  As there was no accessible ice machine the bell-hop that brought our luggage filled the ice bucket for us and subsequent calls to in-room dining ensured that the supply was kept topped up.Our room rate included breakfast which we took in the Rowes Wharf Grille.  I can't fault the fare at all.  Great American breakfast the first morning followed by the weekend buffet breakfast and Steak and Eggs the next.  The waiting staff were among the best, if not The Best I've come across.  Eager to make sure you have everything you want as well as seeming happy and friendly.We called upon In-room dining twice while we were there.  Two of the best and good value for money meals we had during our fortnights trip.  Both the lunch and dinner were delivered promptly and beautifully presented.  They were set up for us on a table by our window so as well as good food we had a great view.With a couple of hours to spare one day we took a wander down to the Spa.  We could have happily stayed there all afternoon.  The pool and whirlpool were empty so we had the place to ourselves.  If you want to use the gym but haven't brought short & t-shirts they have a supply to lend you.  The changing rooms & showers were well stocked with robes towels and gels and like the rest of the hotel immaculately clean.  My one concern when booking the BHH was its location.  It didn't look as central as some of the others I'd looked at.  I needn't have worried.  It was only a short walk to most of the places in Boston we wanted to visit.  And only a very short walk from the local 7/11 if you didn't want to pay minibar prices but fancied a drink of beer/wine/pepsi in your room.The room had no coffee maker which was a bit of a pain but there is a Starbucks right next door and complimentary coffee downstairs in the mornings.Two small niggles.  The corridor from the door into the bedroom was marble, this makes sounds outside reverberate a little so on a couple of occasions we could hear the people walking from the lifts to their rooms.  One evening there was something going on down on the wharf and the amplified singing was very audible in the room but it stopped about 9.45pm so wasn't a major problem.All in all a fabulous hotel and, in my opinion, worth every penny.  I'd have no hesitation recommending it to my friends and family.  We're already planning how to save up for another trip over as there is still much in and around Boston we'd like to see.",0,"October 26, 2014", October 2014,50,NA,NA,40,NA,50,NA,50,UID_5EEE2A6C6F7F5BF4854555A51BA81E52-SRC_236360284,Southend-on-Sea,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hevjd,26,19,"70 Rowes Wharf, Boston, MA 02110-3354"

23676654,89575,60745,The staff seems to know who you are wherever you go,"I chose this hotel because several reviews on this site recommended it as the best hotel in Boston. We had a room on the 10th floor with a city view. We passed across the dome to get to our room - definitely very unique! The carpeting and furniture in the room were all very fresh and new (sometimes even in luxury hotels furnishings tend to look a little tired). As other reviews have mentioned it was really nice that the room included packets of woolite and shout. The toiletries were very high quality. I only wish that the bathroom had a television in it.... The bathroom included a shower/bathtub combo. Bedding was comfortable and the turndown service was a nice touch.We only stayed one night but we never saw another person in the hallway. We felt like we were the only guests... The hotel was extremely quite and personal. When checking in, the front guest staff seemed to know that it was me. I only gave my last name (an unusual one). They didn't ask me to repeat or spell it and found our reservation in seconds. When we went to the pool/spa and had to sign a waiver at the front desk and the man at the desk greeted me by name even though: 1) I have an unusual name; 2) he was looking at the waiver upside down; and 3) I hadn't written particularly legibly. I felt like wherever I went the staff knew who I was! It was almost a little creepy...The spa had a steam room, sauna, several showers with toiletries, hairdryers, etc. It was a very nice spread and everything seemed to be thought of. Although I was very disappointed that the whirlpool was not working while I was there....I was a little disappointed with the ground floor public spaces of the hotel. There was very little seating and lounges where you could sit and talk. Also, we parked in the hotel parking garage. They charge by the calendar day and not by the hour so our less than 24-hour stay cost $68 for parking ($34 per day).This was my first time staying in Boston so I can't comment how this hotel compared to other Boston options - but I wasn't disappointed with it. It was extremely close to Quincy Marketplace!

People behind us were grabbed by cabbies to go in their cabs so they would have a double fare. Awful.Check-in at the hotel was a breeze.  The only disappointment was we mentioned it was our anniversary and had read special things were done for other patrons.  We didn't get that special treatment. The room was a junior suite.  Had a harbor view. Only a couple of complaints.  I wish there was a separate shower.    Because of the placement of the doors to the rooms, it sounded like our neighbors were entering our room every time they came in.

We booked a Deluxe Harbor view room, and it certainly lived up to the title! The furnishings, appointments, bed and pillows were all first rate. The staff performed its duties with great professionalism, courtesy and warmth. In particular, we encountered a Moroccan national named Tariq who spoke lovely French. I speak the language fairly well, and my elder son is studying it in school, so it was nice to be able to practice with a native speaker. We dined at Mamma Maria's in the North End on Friday evening, andI inquired as to whether the ""house car"" would be available to take us (it is walkable, but it was a cold and windy night). It was. And who should be our driver, but the ubiquitous Tariq!Another couple with whom we are friends heard of our plan and booked a room for the weekend, as well. We were able to be on the same floor, and did an evening trip into Quincy Market to dine al fresco on Saturday and enjoy the colors and sounds of Blink, the spectacular Christmas tree show. During the day, we all made use of the pool and spa areas. The spa is terrific, with a great steam room and excellent shower amenities. I used these throughout my stay, and never used the shower in our room! To be more accurate, though, the deluxe ocean view room is more of a mini-suite, with a small sitting room whose sofa has a pull-out bed on the ocean side. The hotel also has a small ice rink set up under the arch for the winter, which my hockey-playing boys also used with great gusto.On Sunday, we used the spa once again, then enjoyed an excellent lunch at the Rowes Wharf Sea Grill. Their soups are outstanding, and the fresh fish selections are first rate. All in all, this hotel provided a wonderful weekend - active, yet relaxing - for our family.

250303770,89575,60745,Awesome Harbour view,"We booked a harbor view over New Year for two nights in this hotel. This was the end of a four-week Boston/Vermont trip for us. The harbor view was spectacular especially for New Years Eve. The bed and linens were of really nice quality. The room was large with a separate seating area and work desk. I liked that the desk had various plug points on it and no need to search for them as your attention is drawn to them by the little open door. Again the bathrobes fit this statuesque girl so I was very happy. The bathroom was a bit of a disappointment after the gorgeous bathroom at the InterContinental and I would hope that the BHH will at some stage upgrade these aspects. We loved that there was a little annex between the bathroom and the room where the cupboard was, it made it easy to stash the suitcases that were dragged around on our long journey. The room was large and décor rather old world but warm and cozy. One gripe was no coffee maker in the room, when my husband and I are working we like to drink coffee and having to go down or order in room service at those prices is just not practical. Another gripe was that the rooms are not very sound proofed and every noise outside in the hall is heard. Unfortunately people are very thoughtless too and listening to the rather drunken return and argument of a couple two doors away on NYE was not great let alone hearing doors slamming and kids pounding up and down the passage. That was my least favourite aspect of the room. There is free Wi-Fi Internet access here.We ate one lunch at Rowes Wharf Sea Grille that was memorable perhaps for the issues we had, but they were taken up with the hotel and management and I have full confidence that they will be sorted. I had a starter of crab cakes and they were the tastiest crab cakes I had my whole stay in Boston and Vermont. Service was a bit shoddy but we were intrigued at the settings and servings of the high tea that were happening at booked tables and we felt that high tea would be a nice event to book for at the Rowes Wharf Sea Grille the next time we pass through Boston. Beautifully set tables with rose petals, a choice of traditional dainties and savories and tea, coffee or bubbly. We had a few drinks at Rowes Wharf Bar on our arrival night, service from the bar ladies was excellent and loved the professional polished uniforms. The barman was very friendly here and enjoyed the interaction. They had a nice Champagne cocktail section and my husband was happy with the rum selection. We had a bowl of soup here, that was good, but the shrimp and chicken wings were hopelessly bad, again this has been taken up with management and I have full confidence it will be sorted.Doormen were fantastically helpful and friendly here and remembered our faces with bright happy loud greetings when we left or returned from outings. The bellman/porter was also great, friendly and helpful. Really all staff was fabulous from doormen to room service. Nightly turndowns needed to be a bit more special we felt, house keeping was good but yet again the bathtub not cleaned out properly. We ordered a small breakfast one morning of two Danishes (they were an apology of a Danish in size) and a pot of coffee. The price tag was blooming huge on this sneeze of a breakfast. As with our previous visit to a nearby hotel three weeks previously, we just decided our best bet was a visit to Starbucks for breakfast that is fortunately literally out the door and a few steps away. We ordered sandwiches as room service one night and also the following afternoon that was New Years day. Room service was very prompt on delivery and they got the order right with no issues. For New Years Eve we decided to stay in and ordered in a bottle of bubbly and a bowl of popcorn (a huge bowl) and watched DVD’s on the DVD player thoughtfully provided with the second TV in the seating area. The view from our room over the harbor as mentioned was spectacular so we caught the spectacle of the fireworks beautifully from our room and did not have to brave the cold or the craziness of the crowds. We loved our room view and the front desk had organized for our late checkout with no issues on our day of departure.

I cannot say enough about this wonderful hotel.  It was my son's first trip to Boston.  I have been there a number of times for business and always stayed at the Four Seasons (which I loved but wanted to avoid because it reminded me of work!)  The Boston Harbor Hotel was perfect.   It started with the reservation.  The listed rate for a double room hovered between $415 and $470 on line.  I made the reservation by phone.  Was quoted $470.  I mentioned that I had seen the price drop online to $415.  The very nice woman at the desk consulted their web site, did not see that price, consulted someone else and came back to me saying that they could give us the room for $295!  Perfect!  The room was beautiful and spacious, over 500 sq ft in an ""L"" shape, with couch, chair in sitting area, two flat screen television sets, a great desk with more than adequate outlets and ports for the laptop, and a balcony overlooking the city -- North Church visible in the distance.  The bathroom was lovely, with a separate vanity area, bench and large mirror  outside the bathroom to allow more than one person to get ready.  Nice touch.  Wonderful, wonderful beds, with Frette linens.  User-friendly alarm clock!  Had a refrigerator, but no mini-bar (contrary to their website representation).  No matter, the refrigerator was handy.   All of the staff were  friendly and eager to help us plan our weekend.  The concierge people became my friends.  We could not have felt more welcome and we certainly needed their help.  Room service is quick -- we used it three times and they arrived every time  as promised within half an hour or less.The Boston Hotel is within walking distance of the North End, a very cool ""Little Italy"" kind of area.  Also within walking distance is the Barking Crab and  the Union Oyster House.  This hotel is right on the Boston Harbor.  A note of caution.  You can take a ferry from Logan airport right to the back of the hotel MOST OF THE TIME.  We decided to go for it rather than rent a car or take a cab in rush hour traffic.  Unfortunately, the ferry is not running now.  This is not the hotel's fault, but the people at Logan told us it was going and we were dropped off by the shuttle bus only to find otherwise.

We found service levels in the restaurant and the hotel overall to be excellent - prompt and polite.  In its earlier days, the hotel's location on the water was great but it had been a bit isolated from the rest of Boston because of the Expressway.  Now that the Expressway has been replaced with a beautiful park, and the waterfront and the seaport district have continued to be developed for recreation, the hotel's location has become very good even if you're visiting Boston for pleasure not business.  It is an easy walk to the North End and Fanueil Hall, and even some of the Seaport area.  It is of course also convenient to the financial district, as it always has been.

The room was appointed in tasteful colonial style furniture - the type of furniture you would expect to see while touring the homes of George Washington or Thomas Jefferson, for instance. Very appropriate and very elegant considering the rich colonial history of Boston. The room and bedroom was what you would expect from a hotel like the Boston Harbor and the location is ideal.

There is a Starbucks next door and a Panera Bread across the street. South Station also has a CVS Pharmacy and several breakfast and take-out booths. I must add that the service is also impeccable - from the door man to the valet to the front desk and concierge, everyone was polite, friendly and helpful. This is an upscale hotel and it is evident the moment you step out of your car. Service is impeccable, the hotel decor is elegant and understated and the views on Rowes Wharf and of the city skyline are fabulous.

Chol, our waiter for breakfast was so pleasant and for lunch, Janice waited on us and couldn't have been any nicer, so very pleasant.  The only suggestion my daughter and I would have is for the amenities.  The smell was a nice lemony one buy a little masculine.  I know it has to be for both male and female but we would like to suggest one we had at another hotel a few years ago.  The shower cream and lotion was called L'Occitane.  I remember we were so impressed.  The men seemed to like it to.  Maybe the Hotel could look into it.  I think people would be very happy.  Other than that this is a first class Hotel that really take care of you.  Bravo !

Location is great - you can walk to anywhere from here. Aquarium train station is only a couple of blocks away as well as any tour trolleys. Plus, if you want to book any tours, reservations or tickets, the Concierge will get it done for you - no worries. The Hotel has that old colonial feel to it - lovely. We had a harbor view center suite and we would sit in our chairs in front of the windows in the morning and evening and watch the boats going by, the airplanes as they were coming in and we also had a view of the bridge where the Boston Tea Party took place. Room was always clean in the afternoon and for turndown, with bottles of water left for us. In fact, the first day we were there, they bought us a platter of fresh fruit and a big bottle of water.  Service and staff were top notch from the front desk to concierge to the doormen/women to servers and cleaning staff. There was always a hello and welcome back and how are you today.  Anything we asked for we got without question and right away. I had started corresponding with Concierge a week before I got there and they had everything ready when we arrived.  Fitness center was nice with equipment for every body part and yoga, pilates & yogalates classes available, which is great to take advantage of. They also give free coffee and tea at the gym and at the Grille in the mornings. Spa was amazing!! Stone massage was so good that we booked another massage the day we were leaving. Liza (desk) was so friendly. Christine, Lily and Myrta made us feel brand new with the massages. The Rowes Wharf Sea Grille was a great restaurant to eat in (see my tripadvisor review on the Grille separately).Just a suggestion: 1. Even though free coffee is given at two different locations in the Hotel, having a coffee maker in the room is even better. Sometimes people don't want to have to get up early and put clothes on for a cup of coffee or tea, when they can have it right in their room. Otherwise, if you want luxury and some pampering, this is the place to go.

We were there in May 2015. The hotel is beautiful, the location is phenomenal and if you stay then you must go for the bay view - it is worth it! Our room was large and the view was amazing. We dined at the Rowes Wharf every morning for breakfast except one, it was absolutely delicious. Pricey for sure, but everything was fantastic (I loved the smoked salmon, and my husband loved the omelettes!).

In fact, the service far surpassed anything we expected (and we've been to five star resorts in Bali where service is out of this world exceptional!).

I gave him a big hug when we left because he was just that wonderful, he made our stay that much more enjoyable. I should also mention that, although the cleaning service was perfect every day of our stay, it was lacking on the last night. Maybe because it was the last night, or someone was having a bad day, but the room was half done when we returned from our beautiful day of touring in Boston. I called the front desk and Daniel the manager assisted us.

The doorman asked if I would like some spring water as he held open the door for me, and I had it in hand as I was was checking in. My room was ready early, and after settling in, I went to the spa for a pre-booked massage. The masseuse was pretty chatty and in a hurry at first, but quickly noticed I preferred a quiet massage and adjusted accordingly. I had an 80 minute hot stone massage which was heavenly. After a nice shower and some lemon water in the locker room, I went back up to my room and chilled out for a while until my nephew arrived. When I came back from a great evening, there were at least 4 people opening doors and tipping their hats, saying ""good evening, welcome, nice to see you,"" etc. My nephew was quite impressed with the service and the room. I was in a king with a sitting room overlooking the city, which was fine. I would have preferred an ocean view as they were located RIGHT ON THE WATERFRONT, but accepted it. After my nephew left, I got ready for bed and crawled in. I am VERY picky about beds; the density has to be just right, the sheets have to be soft cotton with no pilling, the pillows not too hard, not too soft. I was not disappointed. I slept SO well I didn't wake up until 9:00. (My natural awake time is 6:30.) I spent the time I had left before the noon checkout having a nice breakfast in Boston and doing a bit of shopping. I checked out with ease, and was again offered spring water as I waited for the valet to bring the car around. The car doors were opened for me, and after tipping, off I went.

288540150,89575,60745,"Good location, nice extra touches","The Boston Harbor Hotel is in a beautiful location on Rowe's Wharf in the seaport area of Boston. Request a harbor view for incredible views of the water traffic, activity on the wharf, and in the distance, planes taking off at Logan Airport. If you opt for the city view, request a room on a higher floor for great views of the city, including the Custom House Tower and (if you stay between now and October 2015) the huge ""floating"" Janet Echelman sculpture over the Rose Kennedy Greenway. A few particular notes about our stay: -TRANSPORTATION-    We use our own driver in Boston no matter where we stay. The valets and doormen were very clear in their displeasure in our use of our driver instead of the hotel drivers. I understand the desire for guests to use hotel resources, but the reactions were bordering on rude and dismissive. We took an Uber once as well and the reaction was the same. If you need a taxi, be prepared to wait - it took almost ten minutes for the valet to flag one down for us. -COMFORT IN THE ROOM-    The air conditioning in the suites is a bit wonky. You need to leave the door between the sitting room and bedroom open or the bedroom will be swelteringly hot. The staff regularly brings fresh fruit and water to the room, which is a lovely touch and which we very much appreciated. The rooms are very quiet, which is a huge improvement over several other high-end hotels we've stayed at in Boston. -RESTAURANT-    We had breakfast at the Rowe's Wharf Sea Grille in the hotel. It was good, but not particularly impressive. I would venture out for brunch as we always have in the past - there are many spots throughout the city that do a fabulous brunch with more food options, better cocktails, more coffee drinks, at a much better price and with better service. -ROOM SERVICE-   What the restaurant lacks, the hotel makes up for in room service. We opted for drinks delivered both nights as well as one breakfast and snacks on a couple of occasions. I experienced great service when placing the orders, the food and beverage arrive promptly, and the service is impeccable. There are several gluten-free options on the room service menu, which was important to our group. Overall, we had a great visit at the Boston Harbor Hotel and are likely to return. After staying at 6 or 7 hotels in Boston over the last eighteen months, I'd say this is my #1 or #2 choice for next time.",0,"July 13, 2015", July 2015,40,NA,NA,NA,40,NA,50,40,UID_79ADD496CB7E4B6359E85F65A9F7BB10-SRC_288540150,"Portland, Maine",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amysaysom,54,33,"70 Rowes Wharf, Boston, MA 02110-3354"

290514170,89575,60745,Ornate living is one of the perks of being a Princess!,"The Boston Harbor Hotel brought countless smiles to my face.My Dearest’s and my room was delightful with lovely views, comfortable furnishings, and beautiful décor.  The bed and chairs were covered in rich fabrics with a cheerful and imaginative mix of colors and patterns. The furniture was solidly constructed from dark woods with some tasteful light wood inlays.  A nice collection of framed prints hung on the walls. Quality lights in a variety of styles illuminated the room.  The window treatments were gorgeous with intricately patterned sheers paired with curtains in dark hues accented with colorful tassels.  There were mirrors everywhere, so I could indulge in the inexhaustible pleasure of gazing at myself from every angle.  Perhaps the room was a bit ornate, but ornate living is one of the perks of being a princess!I loved the Frette sheets on the bed, the effortless free WiFi, the well-equipped bar, and the first class glassware.  Nice touches like these separate a truly luxurious hotel from an ambitious flophouse with an inflated advertising budget.A few things irritated me.  The air conditioning was dated and made a non-stop rumbling sound.  When I telephoned friends from the room they could hear the rumbling sound too and accused me of staying in a Holiday Inn.  I did not find this amusing!  The closet was so tiny that I had to order My Dearest to keep his stuff out of it.  The light in the closet flickered on and off leaving me to hunt for my clothes in the dark.The bathroom was small and poorly equipped.  There was no shower stall, just a shallow bathtub with a tacky showerhead on the wall above it.  The toilet was not located in a separate little room, which forced me to evacuate the whole bathroom whenever My Dearest settled in for a ride.  There was only one sink so I had to stare at My Dearest’s whisker-studded shaving scum as I brushed my teeth.  The Purple Water soap and shampoo made by Asprey were pleasant enough, but I expect better in a five star hotel.  The toilet paper was single ply but soft and absorbent.  I liked the plentiful thick towels, but there were no towel rings to hang them on.  We had to leave towels on the counter around the sink, where they took up precious space and got soaking wet.  Next to the sink sat a jar stuffed with Woolite, collar stays and other useful things.  Yet another thoughtful touch!The hotel lobby is lined with marble and full of beautiful furnishings.  I adored the large collection of antique maps that hung on the walls of the public areas.  On my next visit I plan to steal one!Service was consistently gracious, polished, and professional.  Both our check in and check out were flawless. The porters and door persons were always welcoming and helpful.The Hotel sits on Boston Harbor so the views of the water are lovely.  However the waterside location means that this Hotel is further away than more centrally located properties from Back Bay shopping, the trendy South End restaurants, and the sexy geeks living in Cambridge.  The Hotel is close to the Financial District and the North End, but how many bankers can you really stand to meet and how much Italian food do you really want to eat?Apart from the rumbling air conditioning and the bathroom that screams for an overhaul, this is a wonderful place to stay.",0,"July 19, 2015", June 2015,40,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,50,50,UID_994CF2F978C9480CAD3B83D4650B195F-SRC_290514170,"West Islip, NY",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tarrytown54,89,318,"70 Rowes Wharf, Boston, MA 02110-3354"

No double bowl vanities in any rooms, from what they told me.  Small tub/shower unit.  Housekeeping was excellent.  Very clean and nightly turndown where everything is cleaned up and replaced.

I had recently returned from a one-year deployment overseas and recently learned that I was now being deployed by my civilian employer to the mid-west for 6-months.  So we thought this would be the perfect excuse to splurge and isolate ourselves.  Before our arrival, I spoke with the concierge and described purpose for our stay.  He understood and took great interest in our pending visit.  I said that I'd like to have flowers delivered to our room before we arrive.  He then asked if I wanted anything else - champagne/strawberries?  I agreed to that.   I mentioned that my wife like the brute - or sweeter flavored champagne.  He was very professional and, yet, he seemed to be truly interested in arranging the details of our visit that it seemed like I just met a friend.  When we arrived, not only was the most beautiful flower arrangement in our room, but the champagne was on ice and strawberries were laid out, too.   To top it off, the hotel had arranged for our room to be upgraded as well.  We had the most striking view of the Boston harbor.  The room was perfectly sized - large and very comfortable bed, a sitting room (where we arranged the chairs to face the large front window to observe the waterfront), and a functional and stylish desk.  The room was simply amazing - beautifully decorated and the colors and fabrics really popped at night.  Our checking was at 3pm and we ate a late lunch at the nearby Northend restaurant, Artu.  But we should have eaten all our meals at the hotel, because we found out later at lunch on the back patio the next day, that they have an amazing lunch menu packed with seafood.  Plus the setting, overlooking the moorings and yachts, is ideal.  The service throughout the hotel is extremely friendly.   We ate dinner at the bar - a very comfortable, clubby feel, where I had the house special, the ""nutty irishman.""  Through out the weekend there were several weddings being held on site.  And my wife asked about how many and they said approximately 5 were scheduled for that weekend.  Yet, it never appeared that the hotel staff seemed overwhelmed at any point.  In fact, they seemed to always have time to help us with questions or special requests.

318230668,89575,60745,Pricey but great location,"Our choice of Boston Harbor Hotel was largely based on its central location, especially the opportunity to have a room which overlooked the harbor. For us, this justified the premium and we were rewarded with two magnificent sunrises and an eclipse of the moon - appreciate that we got lucky with the moon thing.The staff were helpful and friendly and our room was what you'd expect from a 5* hotel, nothing exceptional but very nice. We were close to the lift entrance which meant some noise late at night and so worth checking where your room is when you check in.    Unfortunately, we didn't get to eat in the highly rated main restaurant as we were a bit lagged  after our flight on the day we arrived and it was closed on Sunday, a shame but then we did get to have room service overlooking the harbor at night.A couple of minor niggles would be that for even $500 a night there is no breakfast  included although this was easily solved by getting a takeout from Starbuck's which is right next door. Also, the website sort of implies the spa was in a separate location and is unclear on whether you can or can't access this in your room rate - whereas it looked easy to get too although whether it was free to guests is unclear in the room info.",0,"October 13, 2015", September 2015,40,NA,NA,30,NA,50,NA,40,UID_723D1496CED269CC90B262C6F6081CD8-SRC_318230668,"Cheltenham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Paul N,211,100,"70 Rowes Wharf, Boston, MA 02110-3354"
318394140,89575,60745,Waterfront view,We checked into the Boston Harbor Hotel at the start of a 15 tour of the U.S. We had done a lot of research before choosing where to stay. This hotel deserves its ranking as the number 2 hotel in Boston. Our room was spaciuos and clean with spectacular views across the Harbor. We did encounter a problem during our stay which led to us moving rooms due to the noise created by functions held on the lower floors below our room. Our room was located next to the central atrium hence the noise travelled and was very irratiing. The management bought to our attention that further functions were being held during our stay. The problem was swiftly dealt with as we moved rooms. The management were extremely generous with the compensation they offered us for the inconvenience and very apologetic.The food served at breakfast & dinner was exceptional.

The first part of this review is for the hotel, the second part for booking through TripAdvisorThe hotel is amazing. They make you feel like . My only complaint is that over the phone they told me there were no children allowed in the pool as it was part of the spa. This is not true. They have specific hours children can swim and play.  They tried to accommodate us by giving us a pair of shorts and a T-shirt however it was much too large for my son and I knew it would not work, especially wet. The room was a maculate. The amenities were superb. They always had smiles on their faces and were eager to help. They sent a warm chocolate chip cookie with milk for my son, homemade pastry and chocolates with bottled water for our birthday celebration to the room. Cannot speak highly enough of this hotel and its staff.We booked a great rate through Tripadvisor. I had an email confirming we had a double room with occupancy of three. Two days before our departure I called the hotel to confirm and we were in a king room with occupancy max of two. I called TripAdvisor (Canecelon is the booking agency) back and they told me there was nothing they could do despite me having an email confirming I booked a different room. They were difficult to contact, not nice to work with, and offered no help other than for me to cancel my reservation and rebook it at twice the rate. I called the hotel, they were more than happy to accommodate me at no charge even though I did not book through them. Again spectacular hotel.

328088771,89575,60745,Unreliable quality standards creeping in,"Here is a feedback request I submitted to BHH today, regarding my stay from Monday 11/16 to Thursday 11/19. I'm a frequent customer, disappointed in the recent decline in specific service areas outlined below. Many staff members at reception and the room service team are absolutely wonderful: friendly and professional. However, it seems to not permeate the overall running of the hotel.**************************I have been a regular client since February 2015: it was until now my preferred hotel. I travel to Boston for work only. I work long hours. I had three separate bad experiences during this stay.First, on Wednesday night, I had a bath to relax from a rough week and had an early night. I was awoken to a phone call at 11:30pm by a person (I believe from house keeping) accusing me of keeping pets/ dogs in the room. This was the extreme in unprofessional, rude and obnoxious behavior - ruining my night, causing unnecessary stress. I called the front desk after and they apologized... Second, one evening at around 9pm, when I went to the elevator a staff member asked that I present my key. Notwithstanding that this is supposed to be a nice hotel, I'm a very regular customer, and that the hotel is in a low population/ traffic area, this seemed a bit rude.Third - a smaller matter - the shampoo containers have changed in the last month or so. The previous ones were great - large, squeezable, fresh. Not only are the new ones extremely hard to get fluid out of (pounding against the palm of your hand) the housekeeping did not refill them on any of the three nights of my stay. I only realized every morning, when I did not have time to call down and ask for replacements.On the plus side, I like that you now provide an iphone charger: this is helpful and compensates for the lack of USB ports in the room.The midnight phone call for starters, and it being to accuse me of keeping dogs in the hotel, was absolutely unacceptable. This should never have happened under any circumstances.",0,"November 20, 2015", November 2015,20,NA,20,30,NA,NA,NA,30,UID_6ACBC78AAD096C0609B8F602B8AC61D8-SRC_328088771,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/orpower,4,NA,"70 Rowes Wharf, Boston, MA 02110-3354"

338799078,89575,60745,Disappointing experience!,"I booked a one night family get away for a night of luxury in downtown Boston. I was not price sensitive and booked two adjoining suites so that me, my wife and our two kids could all be together.  We returned from dinner around 9:30pm and that was when the construction noises above us began. Banging, hammering, yelling and other noises associated with room renovations continued directly above us until 11:30pm at night!!!!  Needless to say we made repeated calls to the front desk and were told that the manager was aware of the issue and ""working on it"".  Eventually the noise stopped, but restarted at about 7am the next morning! Most upsetting is that we were never informed any construction was going on in the hotel at all; not in the initial reservation, when we checked in, nor in the nice letters they provide in the rooms (which did regret to inform us that the pool would be closed for unexpected maintenance).  In addition, we were looking forward to ice skating and swimming in the pool, only to discover that the ice rink was far smaller than we had thought, and that the pool was temporarily closed during our stay.  Very disappointing,To their credit the hotel did apologize for the disturbance and refunded the cost for one of our rooms.  The rooms were extremely comfortable, and the concierge service great.

When we pulled up to the hotel - the porter/bellman were great and super efficient and helpful.   The check in was also very well done and pleasant.   We were excited as we were taken up to our room and that was when the first glitch occured.    When we went into our room - there was a cheese tray and some wine with a card addressed to another GUEST!!   That, of course, made us think we were in the wrong room - it was a bit disturbing and kinda took the air out of us.   The bellman called down to see if there had been a mix up and they assured us that room service had simply made a mistake.   We went on from there - but still a bit concerned that we were in the wrong room.   Later that evening after returning from a wonderful dinner at Lucca and a stop by Modern Pastry - we planned on putting the tiramasu in the fridge and it was broken.   But it was 11:15 at night and we didn't want the hassle of calling maintenance as we were ready to relax.   So, the tiramasu remained un-refrigerated but it was cool enough that it didn't get ruined - gladly!!Thought it odd that they didn't have a mini bar and no hairdryer in the bathroom.   Really odd for a hotel of this caliber.   I did use the fitness center and pool and that was a delight!    Almost made up for the glitches we had experience.All the personnel we came into contact with were extremely helpful and pleasant.When we went to checkout the next morning - they had trouble finding our car - in fact brought the wrong one to start with - another glitch - and then we had to wait while they frantically tried to find the car.   The porter ran and got us two waters for the road - a nice touch to make up for our wait!

I could not have afforded it, if I had to pay out of my own pocket.There are many, many things to like here: The location is unbeatable: you get either a fantastic view of the harbor or an equally incredible view of the city. The staff is courteous, knowledgeable and very helpful. My room (a junior suite) was enormous with plenty of space. It had no less than two big plasma tv's, a minibar, a nice marble bathroom with a tub (a separate shower would have been nice), and drawers and cupboards, and closets enough for a whole family. Two things bugged me: the constant buzzing sound in the bathroom. A colleague of mine experienced the same noise in her room, and was told it came from the elevators nearby. But my room was ten rooms away from the elevators, and I still had the same noise. I didn't complain since the sound was only audible in the bathroom, but I really think the hotel management should get rid of it.Another irritating thing was the lack of an electric kettle or a coffee making mashine in the room. There were wine glasses, cups and mugs and every possible convience you could think of, so why make it neccesary for guests to call room service and pay an obscene amount for a cup of coffee or force them to put their clothes on in the morning to go outside af buy one from Starbucks next door? It makes no sense - especially for a coffee-holic like me.

My girlfriend and I have stayed several times, and will certainly keep going back. Before your stay, the concierge is extremely helpful and can assure your room is set up perfectly.  A number of times, I have had flowers and chocolates delivered in advance of my visit, and they have always been set up in the room and tastefully arranged in advance of the visit.The valet and bellstaff at the front door are professional, courteous, and friendly.  The front desk is consistently helpful and prompt as well, and ready to ensure you have everything you need for your stay.  I have to give special recognition to housekeeping.  In many hotels, housekeepers are the invisible heros of the hotel, and this is especially the case at the Boston Harbor Hotel.  At this hotel, however, the housekeeping staff throughout the property manages to be prompt and availble but still unintrusive from the start of the visit - offered and easily accessible if you need something, invisible if you just want privacy.  A number of times, we have needed special requests like ice, glasses, or plates delivered to the room.  I have always been impressed by the availability of the housekeeping staff in helping us fulfill that request (vs. calling down).  Every time, the hotel brings a surprise with them (e.g. chocolate covered strawberries when we just requested plates and forks)I would describe the rooms as more classic and traditional than sleek and modern, and that is the part of the additional charm of the hotel for us.A room with a view of the Harbor has always helped increase the romance factor as well.We have dined at Meritage, and the restaurant also deserves its fine dining reputation.  They did a fantastic job with the recent renovation, and service (like everywhere else) was attentive and unintrusive.During the summer, we also love to sit outside at the Rowes Wharf Sea Grille and listen to music.It is a bit removed from the downtown area of Boston, but it is extremely close to the Seaport District, where there is a lot of exciting development going on.I highly recommend this hotel, and always appreciate the stupendous service.

If you have traveled to major metro areas and have stayed in five star hotels, this one will not only be satisfactory (we've all been burned) but very impressed.  The only thing I don't like is exactly the things you'd expect from such a property.  You will be overly serviced.  I'm kind of a guy who'd rather not be so but call for service when I need/want it.  Other than that, this place is very very nice.  Rooms are finished in a classic, high end manner from the bedding (very comfortable...wanted to skip my 6am wake up and sleep the morning away) to the furnishings and fixtures.  A side note, I'm am also impressed in a property like this that the internet is included (why do most high end hotels charge?) and the mini bar prices were close to the price you'd pay at most bars in the area.  Views are spectacular even for city view rooms.  Great location for North End, FH, Garden, Financial District, etc...which I suppose can be said for most any hotel in the metro Boston are.

371403261,89575,60745,A Very Relaxing Stay,"We stayed 5 nights from 30th April 2016. We don't normally go for upmarket hotels, but this was a special anniversary. The location is ideal, close to all the main attractions. Our first room was well appointed with all usual luxuries of a hotel of this standard, but we realised after the first night that we were next to a service door which was opened and closed all night. Talked to Kristen on reception and were moved within 20 mins. We even had  chocolate strawberries sent to our room as an apology. New room was slightly larger and quiet. Both rooms had harbour views, the second had dual aspect overlooking the town as well. The view of the harbour and airport was magic, but that comes at a cost. The ferries start early and sound their horns on departure. The only improver would be a table and 2 chairs in front of that wonderful view. There was a fireside chair and a footstool. You could truck the office chair up from the other end of the room. We used the Sea Grille Restaurant for breakfast and once for dinner. Prices for dinner were reasonable and the food good. The breakfasts were pricey and apart from the excellent coffee and orange juice, a bit of a let down. There was a buffet on the Sunday morning and all the food apart from the eggs was cold. The other days we ordered from the menu, but even then the food was tepid. The other downside was the inconsideration of some of the business guests. I have never been in a hotel where diners carry out conversations on speakerphone. Maybe I should get out more.All the staff were excellent and there were a lot of them.One suggestion if your flights allow, use the water taxis and not a taxi to and from the airport.

If the review was about iPrefer the score would be zero.  However our meeting was at the hotel and convenience was a priority.The hotel was strikingly beautiful in every way.  Our room was large, very stylish and we loved the city view.  Most of your competitors only know how to decorate with beige and gold.  I loved the addition of blue to the pallet and the use of grass cloth.  The makeup table was very much appreciated by my wife.  The bathroom was spacious and well designed.  I especially liked the shower.The location was perfect.  The busy city was out the front door and the quieter waterfront in back.We dined outside at the Rowes Wharf Sea Grille.  The view was great and so was dinner.I know that you are trying to be modern and appeal to the millennials but I would have preferred the old fashion printed guest information book.All of the staff at the hotel was friendly, helpful and professional.I have only one complaint.  I like hotels with in room coffee.  Sometimes a $20 pot of coffee is inconvenient and over kill when you want a few sips while getting dressed and out the door.  If I have an hour to enjoy a pot with my wife along with room service breakfast that is fine.  I understand that there is free coffee in the lobby but this is not a small B&B where I can slip on my robe and walk 20 steps to find it.  Knowing that you do not have in room coffee as a regular amenity I requested a coffee maker to be put in the room both at the time of the reservation and in response to your pre-arrival email.  Ignoring guest requests is bad policy.  If you can’t or won’t do something you let the guest know politely that service is not available.  I am also in the hotel business.  We are always looking for ways to wow our guests.  Sometimes we need to be a mind reader but in this case I told you exactly what I needed to be happy.  How easy is that?  If I was at the Ritz Calton I am sure that an enterprising associate would have spent 3 minutes online at Amazon and spent $20 and the coffee maker would have been waiting for me.  That is the Ritz Carlton Gold Standard.  With room rates starting at over $500 per night $20 is a small cost to wow a guest.  I come to Boston a lot and there are many great hotels.  A little effort on your part could have made the Boston Harbor Hotel the only place for me to stay in Boston.I did not deduct any points for the coffee because in every other area you performed beyond expectations.",0,"June 2, 2016", June 2016,50,NA,50,NA,50,NA,NA,50,UID_495788FC8D3C75F63FC4BC90F48AB07E-SRC_379139876,White Mountains,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Steve A,187,56,"70 Rowes Wharf, Boston, MA 02110-3354"

Their training must be very exacting, something that has been lost or glossed over at other hotels. From check in to departure, everything went smoothly. Our room was lovely and comfortable. We asked for more pillows and another luggage rack and voila, there they were! We had room service breakfast on one of our mornings and it was delivered right on time and was hot  and delicious.We tried their harbor restaurant for lunch and it,too, was very good.Since we were in Boston for only a day, we arranged for a guide. He was fantastic.We are history buffs and Bill gave us information that we never knew before. The only criticism of the hotel was that it offers very few bathtubs. The room they showed us with a tub was unacceptable.This trend towards no bathtub is disturbing.Finally, we want to single out Ronny and Molly at the concierge desk for their great help and care.

Our room lived up to expectations as we requested a harbour view room which was stunning. The bed was huge and really comfortable, and we both had four perfect night's sleeps!  This was the quietest hotel we have EVER stayed in, with no sound at all each night.The room was well furnished but no facility to make one's own coffee. I know the hotel has coffee in the lobby each morning but I did not want to go through the effort of having to get dressed, put on make up etc,  to go down twelve floors just for a cup coffee. It would not detract from the hotel's well deserved 5 stars if you put a coffee maker ( with different types of coffee pods) in the room. I would like to have sat in the very comfortable armchair watching the boats sail by (and the planes taking off and landing at the airport), drinking coffee! The bathroom was large and the shower was superb, but my only (slight) complaint was that there should have been a stool/chair in there so you could sit down to dry your hair or apply makeup, instead of having to stand all the time.

The BAD: Check-in experience was terrible; their Rowes Wharf Sea Grille Restaurant serves day old rolls, {though after requesting fresh rolls for our $200 dinner, the server finally brought fresh ones@the end of the meal}; 1st morning my breakfast came with coffee ($29-meal), so I gave it to my wife (thus avoiding a $6.00 coffee charge which Server Nora did not like I presume, based on her scowling at me & raising her eyebrows once I informed her I was giving my coffee to my wife). The next morning, the hostess again seated us in Nora's section, who then ignored my family {yet acknowledged me when 1st seated} (& even tho she received a 15% tip the previous morning on the $100 breakfast for myself, wife and three children); thus after ten minutes with not even any water poured, I had to request from the hostess to please give us a new server. {We decided to eat all meals elsewhere after this}. After 3-days of my requesting morning newspapers from the concierge, he arranged papers delivered on the 4th morning, {also stating to me that the check-in staff should have set that up}-(Marriotts ALWAYS sets that up w/out my asking); upon check out, valet brought up the wrong car-having parked mine in a different numbered space than my ticket. The UGLY: Approx. $750 in my 16 year old daughters make up kit, eye contacts and other personal effects all secured in a large bag in the bathroom was removed and thrown away, allegedly by the cleaning staff. After discovery of the missing contents and then bringing this to the hotel staff's attention, I learned they have NO security cameras in the room hallways to review for ingress and egress of rooms. I was also told by management several times that the 17 year employee denied throwing it away, thus leaving the G.M. in a quandry of how to satisfy us-finally agreeing as a ""Gesture of Good Will"" of re-imbursing me his max. authorized amount of only $250.00. {What G.M. for any alleged 5-Star hotel in which our average stay cost over $7,000 would be be given limited authority of only a maximum amount of $250.00?} Unfortunately, the overall experience at this over-rated hotel (in actuality then a 1/2 step down from a 3-Star rated hotel), insures that we will never return for a stay or a meal or valet parking.

Check-in was smooth and friendly, as you would expect in a place like this.  Bellhops were quick with the cart, and to deliver our luggage to the room.  We enjoyed the Sea Grille, as well as Rowes Wharf on multiple occasions during our stay, and the In-Room Dining menu was fabulous, and delicious and the service extremely friendly from each staff member we came into contact with. We had originally planned on going out to Newfound Lake and staying there until Sunday morning when we would need to drive back to Boston for our late afternoon flight home.  But we had enjoyed our stay so much the previous week that when leaving Wolfeboro, New Hampshire at the end of our meetings on Friday morning, we called to see if they had any rooms available for us until Sunday morning.  They did!  We were quite excited to be coming back, and our concierge even found us some great tickets to see the game that night against the Yankees.   All in all, it was a very positive experience for us at this hotel and when we come back to Boston we will definitely be staying here again.",0,"July 16, 2016", August 2015,50, Traveled as a couple,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,UID_A8CE1ABFB4F8166536769681E8F0461A-SRC_393172124,NA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susiemaynard16,8,3,"70 Rowes Wharf, Boston, MA 02110-3354"

We looked a bit like a pack of lost Griswold family members as we ambled through the lobby, but again everyone was kind if not a little amused.The hotel sponsors a live music series that literally is on the water - the musicians are on a floating platform, surrounded by docks with table service.  Awesome.Upon departure we took the water taxi back to Logan to pick up our rental car (because why pick it up early just to pay $30+ to park it overnight + the extra day of rental), and that was super easy.  I'd love to stay here again, but next time - particularly if I'm arriving during the week - I'll leave the flip-flops and Sox hat in the bag and opt for a little dressier attire!P.S.

The location is absolutely beautiful - the area in which it is located is really hopping and ideal for a summer getaway as there is a great vibe on the patios overlooking the pier - really made it feel like summer! people watching on the pier.  The rooms were tastefully appointed and we had a room with the view of the harbour - which was beautiful.  Rooms were nicely decorated in ""nautical contemporary"" and were comfortable.  It is an upscale hotel - but unlike most upscale hotels it has a friendly and accessible vibe. My only complaint was that i found the restaurant for breakfast somewhat slow to serve- the service was wonky - i.e. waiting ten minutes to get a menu if you are eating breakfast a la carte - bringing coffee and no milk - My expectations are higher for a restaurant in a hotel of this calibre and yes i do expect the service to be impeccably detailed.  For logistical reasons we ended up having dinner there as well - it was great to be on the patio on a saturday evening in the summer - and although the service was somewhat better than the breakfast service - it was still slow - waiting too long in between course - the place was full and the wait staff seemed to be doing their best.  We asked the concierge about booking a private boat cruise and they were very efficient in doing this at the last minute - this is an indulgence that doesn't come cheap but its something my husband and i wanted to do as something special- and the concierge arranged a very nice after noon for us.

I asked one of the staff in the hall (event planner?) and she assured me the wedding would be over by 6pm.Fast forward, doors slamming, people shouting until 1am. It's bedtime, why shout you drunkard to hold the elevator because you can't stumble quickly enough to follow your friends. The entire floor doesn't need to know you want the door held. Awful, unacceptable, and with two kids on a road trip, thanks for making my life miserable the next day. So you apologized and waived my valet charge when I checked out. That doesn't make up for putting a family next to a wedding venue. I asked one of your staff if this was going to be a problem and was assured it wouldn't be. What more could I have done?

As a result, the thermostat keeps shutting the A/C off before the room is cooled to the proper degree.  It is very easy to move a thermostat. The thermostat cools down before the room does. Go online and ask Google where a thermostat should be placed and the first thing the articles tell you is to NOT place it that near a cold air outlet vent. This is a problem in every room in the hotel and has created a funky atmosphere in them so much so that the hotel has placed air purifiers in them in an attempt to mitigate the funky atmosphere. Ugh.  The hotel also has a problem with non-guests that patronize the bar after work hours.

The Boston Harbor Hotel is just that type of property. Having enjoyed it several trips in the past, I suggested the property to a group of Business Travelers that I meet with several times a year. We plan our trips a couple of years ahead, so I waited with anticipation as the trip neared. They did not disappoint. My group loved the BHH! The location is prime for the City, nestled on the Harbor and the City and directly across from the Fanueil Hall and Quincy Market Place. Cruises on the harbor, the Aquarium  and several tours are all steps away. Even the wonderful Italian North End is a short walk away. Other top properties may offer the Common or Copley Square, but none offer you such a taste of New England's Capitol City so efficiently. We also had the benefit of room renovations that freshened the venerable 29 year old property so it seemed as fresh as the day it opened. Onsite dining if terrific, dine on the dock amongst the ships, or in the wood and leather of the Rowes Wharf Bar... Whatever you crave... this hotel has a quench for your thirst and hunger... But, as with all Great Properties, its the people and the process that elevate to greatness. Boston Harbor Hotel is no different. Their data of info reminded them that my daughter sleeps better with a humidifier, that the kids love the fresh baked cookies and my room of preference was repeated, as it had been on past visits. Slightly disappointed that this room did not contain the balcony that I've enjoyed in the past, but, that waned quickly as we were immersed in the friendly, classic welcome and care of everyone from Bell Services, to Door man, to the wonderful House driver ... well everyone that works there and seem to do it more out of passion than duty.

The bell captain walked us and our luggage to our room. The room was already turned down for the night so the blinds were closed.  The bell captain opened the blinds with a slight flourish to reveal a huge picture window with the most breathtakingly beautiful view of Boston Harbor. Truly stunning. The deluxe, King, harbor view room itself was well appointed, very clean, modern and large. The Summer concert series was going on at the restaurant several floors below, so we opened the windows in our room to hear the live music while we readied for dinner.  The rooms are fairly quiet with the windows closed, other than the concert music and occasional boat horn. We could not hear any noise coming from inside the hotel.

427467043,89575,60745,Just so Boston...,"My reviews are rated based on location, rooms, service, restaurant and miscellaneous items. Five is the highest score.1) Location 5/5 - Rowes wharf, aquarium, around five blocks through the rose garden/ big dig to the north end, Quincy market. Tip: water taxi is behind the hotel.2) Rooms 4/5 - Booked FHR rate for a junior suite overlooking the city. No upgrade but they were full. Thought I would miss the harbor view but I liked the city view. We were on the 14th floor in newly renovated rooms. Beds were comfortable, linens were great. Bathroom did not have a tub, no separate door for the toilet or any perks like tv or heated seats. The bathroom was not large for a suite. There were two tvs and a sofa bed which was comfortable. Cons: no coffee maker in the room, unusual for this day and age.3) Service was 5/5. Everyone was attentive and pleasant. Nothing was a burden to them and they anticipated our every need. 4) Restaurant 3.5/5 - we had lunch at the harbor restaurant since breakfast seating had a waiting list and open table somehow was not working that morning. Food for lunch was okay, service again was excellent and the views were great. Tips: Restaurants at the North End are much more fun. Cannolis at modern pastry and mike's pastries are equally delicious. Go to the one with the shortest line and bring cash.Summary: It is classic Boston with the nautical theme and harbor view. If you like maps, you can check the old maps of Boston before the land fill of 1800s. Go for the renovated rooms and higher floors. I prefer the city view on higher floors since I can grab the harbor view from the restaurant anyway. Service and location is excellent.

We all arrived in a big bus, so this would not have been difficult to do. There were two bars set up with only one bartender each. This made for painfully long lines. Just as we sat down a server came over and asked what we would like to choose for our main course. I hadn't even pulled my chair all the way in yet. I told him we had just now sat down and asked if we could wait a few minutes. He told me we could not because speeches were staring and they needed to know RIGHT NOW. This is an annual meeting we have attended now for 15 years and always goes the same way. The rush was completely unnecessary. The portions were not well planned at all. The less expensive option of ravioli was way too much while the fish option was tiny. The way this society works, we all pay for our meals so we know exactly how much it cost per person. At the start we were asked if we would like red or white wine. Most people switch during their main. This was not an option because they quickly cleared the glasses once we made the choice. I asked for a red wine glass for my husband and was told not now because they were clearing. I had to get up and walk out to where the bar was set up to get him a glass and filled it along the way when I spotted the wine bottles nearby. We live in the area and often host events. It would take a ton of convincing for us to consider this as a venue.

There is turndown service in the evening as well- a nice touch as many hotels are not doing this anymore.  We had left 2 books on the nightstand and when we returned, bookmarks had been placed in each of the books.  Nice touch!  The only minus was the accessible shower left a puddle of water on the bathroom floor after each use.  We ordered breakfast from room service and it was delivered on time by a friendly and efficient staff person.  The breakfast was delicious and the waffles were accompanied by warm maple syrup, a very nice touch.  The Health Club is excellent.  The fitness room contains many cardio machines, free weights, and weight machines.  There are water, towels, headphones, newspapers and magazines available.  The locker room is large and well-equipped with all shower necessities, including combs, razors, and hairdryers.  There was a sauna and steam room in the Women's Locker Room.  The sauna was very clean and looked like it was newly done.  The showers had terrific water pressure and all the shower amentities you might need.  The salt water pool is an added plus for those that like to swim laps.  It is 60 ft long and there are kickboards and pull buoys for your use.  In addition, I forgot my goggles, but the front desk had ones to borrow.  After your workout, there is coffee, tea and juice available in the healthclub lobby.

The Harbour view rooms were slightly more expensive, but you won't be disappointed with the view of the city and external noise was not an issue.There were two TV's in the room, however, due to the good quality sound they emit, the bass could be heard coming through the neighbours walls despite the volume not being too loud, but thankfully, the TV was turned off at a reasonable time and the rooms were actually very quiet and the beds comfortable, so a decent sleep was achieved.My only niggle was on the third day of my stay, when returning to my room at 4:30 pm, the room had not been made up. My wife and I had been out all day and wanted to rest before taking a shower prior to going out for the evening.The Housekeeper knocked on our door at 5:45pm to make up the room. I just told her not to bother and we can make our own bed. I think there must have been some language barrier as she returned twice to make up the room which was inconvenient when we were getting showered and changed. Again, we told her not to bother.After our evening out, it would seem that the lady who does the turn down service at least made an effort to make up the room while we were out.The following day was when we were due to check out and unbelievably, the housekeeper knocked on our door at 09:00 am to make up the room. You should not have Housekeepers pestering you that early on the day you are checking out as guests are usually busy packing and getting ready for departure.I am not criticising the standard of housekeeping as the rooms were immaculately clean, but there must be something wrong with the systems or scheduling that needs to be addressed. I had to remove a point off my rating for a service that most hotels can manage successfully.Other than this relatively minor issue, we enjoyed our stay at the BHH and I would certainly recommend the hotel for location,quality of rooms and friendly staff.",0,"December 3, 2016", November 2016,40,NA,NA,30,NA,50,NA,40,UID_23E98BEBEDD2F6DEA4052A7D986FB769-SRC_441766925,"Durham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davyp777,113,103,"70 Rowes Wharf, Boston, MA 02110-3354"

Our room was tastefully decorated, and spotless. The housekeeping staff at this hotel is some of the best we've ever experienced in our decades of travel. Both daily and turndown service had our room as fresh as when we checked in.This room had lots of unexpected amenities: free shoeshine service, collar stays (DH was very happy as his seem to disappear at the cleaners), woolite, makeup remover, as well as the usual lotion, Qtips, etc. This location was 3 blocks from the South Station T and the Aquarium T stops. We were walking distance to the North End and Quincy Market. We had amazing summer weather the weekend we were here in February.  How nice to be able to open the window to get the summer like breezes in the room.Two minor cons: no coffee in the room.  The pad provided in the room nor other materials referenced coffee was available in the lobby restaurant. We did not know this until we checked out and it was too late. This should be noted on the pad so people are aware. Also, I could not locate anywhere on the pad the check out time.

From the moment you approach the property you can not help but be amazed by the cordiality of every single person you encounter.  I consider myself somewhat well traveled and I can truly say I don't think I have ever stayed in a hotel with such consistency of friendly, helpful service.   Boston Harbor Hotel is probably the nicest or one of the nicest hotels in Boston.  The waterfront location and sheer elegance of the architecture is without parallel.  Perhaps that is what makes the warmth of the staff even more surprising.  Luxury hotels typically offer top notch service...polite doormen,  professional and courteous desk staff, etc.  But what separates the staff at the Boston Harbor Hotel from the rest is that the experience is more than just being served by courteous professionals.  The staff is quick to smile, laugh and remarkably warm....not a trait I find common amongst five star hotels.   Of course the suite was magnificent, the bed linens lovely, the view of the city pretty, particularly as the evening approached.  But by far the thing that made this hotel a hotel my sister and I shall not forget was the charming doorman who after loading our luggage, rushed back to the car to suggest he get us bottled water for our drive.  Or the three or four people at the front desk who chuckled when we did at the sounds a 2 year old boy, displaying his bright red plastic fireman hat, made as he raced through the lobby imitating a firetruck.

We selected this hotel because I've always wanted to visit it, especially after my niece worked there this summer.  This is undoubtedly a stellar hotel and its mark was made when, among three hotels, it was the only one which responded to my pre-visit questions.  We arrived to a beautiful room, and a comfortable, elegant hotel.  A perfect location, a short walk from the Aquarium stop, on the water(I might have taken the water taxi had it been warmer).  The staff seemed minimal and unobtrusive, but always there when we had a question or concern.  However, a few (3) minor things bothered me enough so that I sent a message to the hotel, since its notes in the room indicated that comments to improve service were invited.One of the things that holds a 5 star hotel above a 4.5 is not only attention to details, rotely, but a recognition that they matter in whatever form they take to the guest.  This is what the BHH did for me--the manager acknowledged my concerns, told me they were legitimate, and rectified them.  In fact they went overboard, and I appreciated it immensely.Was it the plushest hotel I've been in in Boston?  No.  But  they put me first, even if I had to give them a little nudge.

486784728,89575,60745,Enjoyed my stay but could be improved,"This is an expensive hotel which is in a good location on the harbour but has some odd characteristics.   I had a good-size harbour view room - I think it was called a Junior Suite but could be wrong - with a  comfortable bed, but the room was rather lacking in basics. For example there was nothing with which to make tea or coffee. When I asked, it seemed to throw the staff into a lot of confusion; and it was only after a couple of attempts that I had  an electric kettle delivered so that I could make a hot drink. Also, there was one of those fridges where if you lift anything out you get charged so it was really hard to store the milk for my tea/coffee! Again this seemed to be hard for the staff to deal with. So, it wasn't very homely at all. During the full day I stayed there I was thirsty, from jet lag, during the afternoon, and wandered down to the restaurant to see if I could get a green tea bag. (By this stage In knew it would be pointless ringing down for one!) But I waited at least ten minutes to find that they didn't have any - which I assumed they would, from breakfast - and they actually 'manufactured' one from gauze which tasted pretty awful. I ended up going along to a 7-11 to look for supplies. There's one about 5 minutes' walk away.The hotel seemed quite empty, which is probably explained by the high prices and lack of service. There's a breakfast buffet which is fine. On the other hand, the hotel has a room with a  wonderful collection of historic maps, which I would probably have visited anyway while in the city!

494200193,89575,60745,Amazing!,"I would HIGHLY recommend BHH for any special event !!  We have stayed at this hotel many times, in the past, and have always had a great experience.  So, it was a natural choice when planning our daughter’s 16th birthday. We wanted a special experience for our daughter and her friends and BHH did not disappoint.  The plan was for the girls to have dinner nearby, then go back to the hotel…swim, relax, spend time on the terrace of their room.  With the help of everyone at the hotel, particularly Rachel in reservations and the concierge, Nathan , the girls had an experience they will never forget.  From the moment I called the hotel, to discuss my plan, Rachel was amazing.  She helped me plan how many rooms I’d need and where they’d be located.  She was friendly, helpful and genuinely seemed interested and excited to help make this work.  In fact, upon arrival, my daughter learned that Rachel had created a special geo-tag for snap chat, just for her.  That was an amazing touch, first because my daughter and her friends loved it, but also because it showed that Rachel had actually listened when we spoke and paid attention when I talked about the girls.  After booking, I worked with Nathan to arrange flowers and balloons.  It was all PERFECT… the room looked amazing!  He also took delivery of the cake and made sure it was set up in the room for when we returned from dinner.  Nathan made check-in a seamless experience and made us feel so welcomed and relaxed.  The hotel even sent up fruit, popcorn and root beer for the girls to snack on before dinner.  EVERYTHING was spectacular.  It seemed as though the entire hotel knew it was my daughter’s birthday.  As with every stay we’ve ever had at BHH, the doormen, bellman and front desk were so friendly and helpful.  Room service was wonderful.  All in all, it was an AMAZING weekend thanks to the entire staff at this hotel.  When my daughter got in the car, as we were leaving, she looked at me and said, ”It seemed like everyone who worked there knew who I was and that it was my birthday.  Everyone I saw (staff) said Happy Birthday to me, even if I didn’t  know who they were”  She ended with “that was the best night EVER”…enough said!",0,"June 19, 2017", June 2017,50,NA,50,NA,NA,50,NA,50,UID_044886E93E96704F36EC6371387E14F5-SRC_494200193,"Ashland, Massachusetts",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/egold96,25,14,"70 Rowes Wharf, Boston, MA 02110-3354"

It certainly could not have worked out any better!  We drove to the hotel and upon pulling up to the entrance, were greeted by the 'biggest' smile in New England. The doorman, impeccably dressed, wished us a warm welcome and directed us in while he handled our luggage. In taking us to the front desk, he introduced us to his colleague, wishing us a wonderful stay. She was quite welcoming herself and made sure to review the details of our stay as well as the surrounding area and its various attractions. Lastly, she directed us to concierge to discuss dinner arrangements (throughout our stay they recommended several restaurants, all amazing in their own right). Our room was simply outstanding; elegant and well-appointed and remarkably spacious. It made us feel 'pampered' to be staying there. Especially enjoyable was having in-room breakfast at our window, overlooking the harbor. Service was of the utmost standards. Anytime we interacted with staff, it was a warm and well-received conversation. Any and all requests were accepted with delight and honored. Concierge was completely engaged in our needs and desires. And everyone seemed to know our names.Though we did not dine in, the hotel's restaurant was visually stunning, with food to match according to some fellow guests.The hotel's location is virtually perfect, as it is a short walk to 'anywhere and everywhere' be it the financial district, the Freedom Trail (a must!) or through the heart of the area featuring countless cafe's/bakeries and small restaurants/eateries. Even an evening walk to Legal Harborside (a different review- pls read) was exceptionally enjoyable as your cross a bridge over the harbor.Checking out was bittersweet, though as seamless as checking in.

First bad noise experience on June 30 due to a very loud wedding reception. Our room was on 10 and a small balcony at end of hall overlooked the cocktail hour on 9th floor.  The noise, music, and especially screaming echoed through the hall.  Normally you have to deal with this.  But what got me was we called the front desk to find out what the noise and music was and whom ever answered and acted dumb with ""there's music outside your room?"" meanwhile I can hear it on the phone.  Then he said ""hold on I have to check I don't know"". Then came back and said "" its for the wedding"". Like we should know all about the wedding.  No excuse for this response in a hotel of this level.

In the afternoon we also enjoyed the music playing on the floating dock and could view the activity on the harbor walk below.   Security was at a high level and guests had to show their room card, personal identification and go through a bag search to enter the hotel.  Large town vehicles were positioned in front of the hotel and police were stationed on sidewalks, on bikes, in boats and at a command center around the corner.

Boston Harbour Hotel is very fortunate to have the best location out of all the hotels in Boston. It is situated right on the harbour (obviously!), so a very short walk away from all the attractions, such as the aquarium, shopping and cruises, which is lovely and convenient. If you get a harbour facing room, you can have the most spectacular view of Boston Harbour day and night. The rooms were spacious, tastefully decorated and comfortable with all the modern amenities, such as an iPad by your bed and an HDMI cable (very thoughtful!). However, one thing which I found a bit cheeky was the fact that in your room, you have what looks like some complimentary snacks such as nuts, gummy bears and a bottle of water waiting. However, as soon as you pick them up, you hear a click and realise that they are on one of those pressure mini bar automatic charge to bill things. I know it is an 'oh silly me kind of thing', but I can't have been the only person to do that, and I just think it's a bit cheeky with the price you're paying and you should at least put a little note card explaining that once you've picked something up, you've paid for it and can't put it back! The spa is very well done and the restaurants are great, with excellent food and live music which is a nice touch, but again, quite pricey, so be prepared to pay top dollar. I will say that, although it is expensive here, I feel like it is worth it as you do get what you pay for at BHH.

(No chocolates though on the turn-down service :-( which was a surprise!)Couple of little negatives to mention - they arranged us a cab to go to a restaurant they recommended and turned out the driver had no clue where it was and we had to get out in a dark road and find our own way!  Also, and I only realised this after when my friend asked what I thought of the lovely pool and realised that when we arrived, no one mentioned the hotel's facilities at all, option for breakfast etc, I know we could have asked but just didn't think so we might have missed out quite a bit.

The location is lovely. It's in the heart of things.  The sea views are lovely. The weather was amazing.  But the hotel is a little dated, a little too ornate, the food was average.  Service is nice but i don't think the property is entirely can-do.   I was a bit upset we didn't get a harbor view knowing we were hosting so many people and after they told us no rooms were available yet members of my team were overlooking the water.  They had us in a suite and I said I was willing to take a smaller room if they could get us a sea view. No can do.  They said they had nothing.  Our room was also a little clunky. We felt like we were in a fishbowl overlooking 'the city' but directly across from office buildings on one side and a roof and ventilators on another.  The  bathroom was right by the entrance and from there there was a living room and then a bedroom and it didn't flow.   Bathroom TEENY tiny - No bathtub. A shower whose shower door opened into the bathroom door and the bathroom door opened into a tiny closet and it's door so it was like a jigsaw puzzle moving around especially with two people.  One sink, Two towel sets instead of three or four. It was just odd. The restaurant was so-so. The hospitality nice but not warm and inviting.  The bellmen were the friendliest of the bunch. The bartender a bit grouchy because we couldn't get our drink right. The server couldn't manage the details of getting our drink orders right and one time forgot two orders for our colleagues completely.   IN all we had a nice stay but not a great one.  Would I go back? No. Would I recommend it? Probably not. Some nice touches in the room. Water complimentary. A bottle of wine greeting us. FreeWifi, a bookmark from the hotel tucked into the book I was reading on my bedstead. But aacckk! No coffee makers in the room.  Not good in this day and age at this caliber property with the room rates we paid.  Bed was great. Terrific nights sleep. Firm mattress and comfy pillows.I'd probably try or recommend the Four Seasons and I""m told there is a beautiful property a bit north along the water alongside a lovely pier. I'll definitely try something else.  Good - not great.  If I had a 3.5 button I'd do it but in this case I'm ranking a four because 3 is average and this place is a cut above that.  Being here with my hubby was fun. A gal wants to enjoy couple time while on business but not a really great place to do that. Lovely weather.

We absolutely loved it, and it was our favourite of the three hotels we stayed in during our trip to Boston and New York. The staff were extremely helpful and the attention to detail was very good.Our room was stunning. We had a harbour view room, which was well worth paying the supplement for as the view across the harbour towards the airport is spectacular, seen through floor-to-ceiling windows. The room was very big, with a large seating area in front of the window, and a separate dressing area, as well as a great bathroom with Penhaligon's toiletries. The turndown service always left us each a bottle of Fiji water.One of our favourite features of the hotel was the breakfast. The serving staff were great, and couldn't do enough for you. For instance, one day I hadn't finished my orange juice and instead of leaving it, they gave it to me in a sealed plastic cup to take away, and filled the cup up to the top as a bonus! When we were leaving breakfast each day, they always offered us a coffee to take away. And the breakfast, which we had on an inclusive rate, was always too large to finish. On the Saturday, they offered a buffet-style breakfast, rather than a la carte, but the buffet offered a very varied selection and we liked it just as much.We also loved the swimming pool and spa. Gym clothes are provided for you if required, and the pool is around 20m long, so ideal for swimming lengths. The spa had a calming atmosphere and I had a fantastic massage one day.If we were to find (slight) fault with the hotel at all, it would be to point out that its location is not right in the centre of things.

It’s a good walking location with interesting sights to see, walking distance to the North End and Fanueil Hall….and a taxi, uber or subway ride to everything in Boston. The hotel’s fine dining restaurant, Meritage, pairs beautiful food with appropriate wines, while the more casual eatery, Rowe’s Wharf Sea Grill and Bar, offers a broad menu of appetizers, soups and salads, lighter fare and full dinners. We found the food, drinks and service excellent. Room service breakfast and dinner were on time, hot and delicious, served with a smile. My sister and I had planned a weekend of catching up, reading by the pool, swim time, a little bit of exercise, and good food and drink. We had booked massages and facials in advance. We loved being gently pummeled to a jelly, achy muscles relaxed and skin glowing. We went at a busy time, so prices were high, but we felt the level of comfort and service were worth it. I’ve since noticed on line that the same cosseting can be enjoyed at lower cost at less busy times.

547150879,89575,60745,Boston Harbor Hotel,"I stayed at this hotel last year and it was one of the very few hotels i have given a five star rating, so i was really looking forward to going back. I am a regular traveler and have stayed in many hotels so when i provide a 5 star rating, in my world, that means the hotel has been first class.The hotel was once again excellent in all it's services bar one incident which i will mention later. The restaurants,  bars, spa/Health Club exceeded expectations  as before and i really enjoy the hotel with its atmosphere and amenities.The incident which let it down and why i cannot provide a five star rating was that the weekend we attended the hotel was 8th and 9th December. This was obviously a very busy time for office Christmas parties and added to the lovely festive activities.The issue i had was that on both the Friday and Saturday night my room was surrounded (and had changed customers to allow for 2 different night parties)  by people attending their office parties, so between 0300--0430 they were returning to their rooms and creating a lot of noise.On the Sunday morning i went to reception to mention the noise and just to say that i totally understand why the noise occurred and i understood because i am sure that has been me on many occasions, What i was trying to say was that the guests for the office parties should have been kept together and guests who had booked in for a vacation should have been placed together away from the noise.Unfortunately the receptionist was very dismissive and asked if i complained during the night. I said no as i had no issue with guests enjoying themselves and that my problem was with the hotel's room allocation.In the end i just said this is my advice so other guests might have a peaceful nights sleep while on vacation.For that reason alone i have had to mark down the hotel.",0,"December 14, 2017", December 2017,40,NA,30,40,NA,NA,NA,40,UID_B2ABEEB62EB6920AD87A9BDBBD034FB5-SRC_547150879,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravellerP16,25,19,"70 Rowes Wharf, Boston, MA 02110-3354"

Every minute detail at this property was examined for perfection and then polished to a high sheen. The entire stay was perfectly orchestrated by the staff; from the door men and bell hops to the check in personnel, from housekeeping to concierge and through the restaurants the theme was ""perfection"", and it was achieved at the highest level.  The respect the staff have for their guests, and their individual role in presenting this property as a five star destination, is evident in both word and commission. I haven't encountered a more willing and able group to provide accommodations at this level anywhere in my travels.  Check in was accommodating in every way. Early check in? ""Yes sir, our pleasure sir"".  Bell men above and beyond. Cab please? ""No sir take the house car"".  House keeping? The room was immaculate. The furnishings were done with great taste and reflective of the region. Bedding was comfortable with high thread count sheeting. Every amenity covered or available if needed. The house limo driver Dave, is as good as they come. Friendly, knowledgeable, courteous and professional. He got us to the TD Arena in a manner that left us completely in awe of his abilities as a chauffeur., He navigated, what some would consider the worst traffic on the planet, like the thirty year pro that he is.The limo drivers in Vegas should come to him for advanced training in their craft!  He was waiting for us before we even knew it was time to depart after the event. A stop for Italian pastries in North Boston was the perfect end to a one of a kind experience.  Restaurants? Incredible service and top of the line in culinary offerings and preparation. Renoir waited on us twice at the Wharf restaurant. A finer server than he  would be difficult to find. Every person we met in this hotel would be the top performer at any other destination we have traveled to. Congruent with the Patriots in this same City, the Management of this establishment has found the creme de le creme to assist them in presenting the best service team we have encountered anywhere.

We attempted to venture out and explore Boston, but decided that we would be more comfortable spending the evening lounging in our room and ordering in. We were delighted with our experience from the time we arrived until we left. We found the bell staff to be friendly and the front desk staff was friendly, professional, and efficient. The room was clean and well appointed with comfortable furnishings. The city view was fantastic. The bathroom was very clean and well appointed, but had a tub rather than a walk in. The tub was clean and functioned properly so I didn't mind. We also enjoyed the scent of the soap so much that we bought some on our way out to the airport. We were in a handicap accessible room (we were not handicapped) and found that the bathroom lacked hooks for towels and clothing. I assumed that since the bathroom was modified that this was an oversight of the retrofit. The food we ordered for in room dining was fantastic. I especially enjoyed the lobster salad croissant. The following morning we enjoyed a delicious breakfast overlooking the frozen landscape from the comfort of our room. The room had a coffee maker with coffee pods, but the pods were hidden out of sight and I almost did not see them; however, the coffee served with my breakfast was much better.Every single member of the staff that we encountered was friendly, helpful, and was focused on ensuring a comfortable experience.My husband and I look forward to booking a room for our anniversary next December!",0,"December 30, 2017", December 2017,50,NA,50,NA,NA,50,NA,50,UID_AD3619687FBD7E70DA49196AC0A607AE-SRC_550301451,NA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anthony J,1,NA,"70 Rowes Wharf, Boston, MA 02110-3354"

I do not think this was the hotel's fault but on the Saturday night of my stay - frustratingly, my first night there and my first night in the USA after having flown in from London - the noise in the corridor outside my room was horrific.  People were yelling, running and slamming doors from 11pm until about 3am.  There was also significant noise from the elevators and from the rooms either side of me.  Perhaps stupidly, I didn't complain because it was only one night and, it being my first night in the hotel, I was not entirely sure what to expect.  I was also, frankly, too exhausted and jetlagged to have the energy to call the front desk and grumble.  If the other three nights had been like this, however, I would have been asking for a refund and warning against ever staying here.  Mercifully, however, the other three nights were more or less silent (apart from a bit of elevator noise) and my stay was pretty perfect in every other way.  Staff were helpful, the free Wifi was fast, the bed was comfortable, the view of the harbor amazing, the room service food tasty and promptly delivered - everything you could ask for.

The first time we stayed here was October 2005 for about one week.  From the moment we arrived I felt that the staff was genuinely concerned with our hapiness.  Our two young children were given little stuffed animals upon check in and every one in the lobby remembered them whenever we went through.  Joseph, one of the valets, asked us how we liked the cookies in our room upon arrival.  When I mentioned they hadn't been there he sent up the cookies and milk for the kids along with a bottle of champagne for my husband and me.  The room was a good size (I believe we usually stay in a deluxe harbor front).  There was a sitting area in additon to the sleeping area.  I did not think the furniture was very dated and I thought the bathroom was fairly good (not the Four Seasons Maui but come on how many really are).  The bed was very comfortable and housekeeping was excellent.We ordered room service several times during each of our stays and it was always good.  The gym and pool at the spa are very nice, excellent really.  The service here is great as well.The thing about this hotel that just floors me every time is the service.  The concierge is always great.  They have arranged town cars at a moments notice, made and changed restaurant reservations without complaint and arranged fun outings to take the children on.  Every one at this hotel seems happy to be working there.

The bathroom was adequate, not huge. They have put a chair in there by the vanity shelf,  which is awkward when the bathroom door opens unexpectedly!I specifically asked for a room away from the lifts, which seemed to be the case on first glance. However, the service lift ran at the back of the bathroom which was very noisy from 6am to midnight. There is a lot of building work going on at the hotel so when the hot water ran out on the second evening we thought this was the problem. Reception were very quick to send up an engineer to see what was going on. All he did was run the taps (faucet) for five minutes & declared the hot water was coming through. Unfortunately, the third evening was the same scenario. Lukewarm bath & shower ☹️ (this was really annoying as I had only booked the premier room because it had a bath tub!!!). On check out we were asked if we had enjoyed our stay, whereby we told them of the problems. Very sympathetic & also confirmed our initial suspicion that the building work had caused the problems with the hot water situation.

594148291,89575,60745,Is was pretty good...but inconsistent,"We arrived very late due to a delayed flight. We reserved two rooms through Expedia. We were traveling for a special occasion. After viewing a third set of rooms, we finally found some without a roof view & not next to the noisy service elevators (rooms ending in 06). It was exhausting. I think they reserve these less desirable room locations for second party bookings. We did pay for harbor view for one room & they did upgrade the second room to be next to it. I don't think it should have taken three sets of rooms. Buyer beware.Harbor view rooms have good views from floors 12 up. The hotel is clean & very upscale, but going through renovations. Many areas need renovation--again clean, but outdated. Somewhat of a hodge-podge of older & newly renovated. Clean, but not Four Seasons clean--don't look in corners, air grates, & backs of doors--eek!Service was hit & miss. The bar/lounge servers were great. Some housekeeping was excellent others were intrusive. Outdoor dining had nice ambiance, but food was only decent & service was poor.Overall it did seem safe & secure--but elevators don't require a room key to operate, if that concerns you.Pool is closed for renovation.",0,"July 8, 2018", July 2018,40, Traveled with family,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,UID_89B82C3FCDE804FA44A4210F7EFC2707-SRC_594148291,"Galesburg, Illinois",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KRednet,3,NA,"70 Rowes Wharf, Boston, MA 02110-3354"

596164373,89575,60745,Nearly exceptional ,"We stayed in here for three nights in July whilst travelling to and from the area on business. Hotels always lose points when under renovation for me, but it wasn’t too bad. The rooms we stayed in were very nice and hard to fault. Clean, tidy and well decorated. Our first problem came in the hotels restaurant. Travelling with a 22 month child does have challenges and dinner is one of them. Trying to get the hotel to make anything that our son could eat proved extremely frustrating. They didn’t have Mashed Potato on the menu which we thought was weird but they managed to find some from another of their restaurants and their idea of “soft” vegetables left quite a lot to the imagination. We had to send the food back quite often to be cooked longer so our son could chew it and this made lunch / dinner time troubling. Our food that we had was nice enough, with the exception of the fries. These were too thin & crispy for our taste and wet in oil. Maybe it was a local thing but it wasn’t to our taste. But on the whole the restaurant was good. The other problem we had was with the WiFi. Mine and my wife’s phone wouldn’t hold on to the connection and my wife has to stop working on her laptop in the end as it kept dropping out. In the end I resorted to 4G and that worked great. But we were left wondering why a hotel in this part of the city ( the business district ) had such bad WiFi? Anyway - even with these issues we’d still stay here again. The staff were great and extremely friendly to us as a family, and the harbour setting was very picturesque, especially at night. Four star this time but if they smoothed out some rough edges it would definitely get a five.

596802702,89575,60745,Second visit...wildly different experience,"My second stay at this hotel, first was leisure and I loved it. This stay was a different experience.Flights were cancelled at Logan so I thought I would enjoy the evening in Boston and stay here so the extra night was a pleasure not a chore. A lovely warm evening.Firstly on check-in, hard to be sure but I detected a certain attitude in the receptionist, John I think it was. The sickly sweet service attitude that comes across as fake and putting it on. “I have a wonderful junior suite for you” which clearly it was not. On my previous stay I did have a wonderful room. Oh and an aside a “welcome back” would have been nice. This room was the last one on the floor, a long way from the elevator. It felt tired. There was no plug for a laptop anywhere near the desk. And worst of all the air conditioning was a joke. I went out for the evening with the air on 66 degrees and high, when I returned at 10pm the room was as warm and stuffy as when I left it. Similarly I went to bed and I woke up hot - the air turns itself down it seems when on for any period of time. Given I had to leave get up at 4am I was not about to start trying to change rooms. No bath only a shower which was also disappointing. I asked reception when I checked in what the surest way of getting to the airport would be at 4:30am as I had to make my early flight. “We book taxis in this situation sir”. Is it 100% guaranteed I checked? Clearly I would have booked a private car if not. “Of course sir”. Guess what? At 4:30am no taxi. The bell hop told me it was not unusual with taxis. 10 minutes later and luckily a taxi came past.  Not sure what the booking was for but it didn’t materialise...there’s that receptionist again...On another note, the outside bar/lounge area was not open. Sunday evening I suppose. I asked the lady on the restaurant terrace desk if it would be possible to have a drink sent the the waterside seats. No. You can go inside to our bar for a drink.At that point I opted to go back to the terrace at the Intercontinental where I had stayed for 3 nights the week before, and is my normal Boston hotel. Open, lively, great service, has evening sun and generally welcoming.I made my last minute booking at the Boston Harbor Hotel on a 3rd party site as I booked about 45 minutes before showing up and this was the fastest way of finding a room. As another reviewer commented this may be partly to blame for the poor room quality and receptionist’s attitude. If so the hotel should not make rooms available on 3rd party sites at discounted rates - it damages your brand to offer different levels of service and room quality based on booking channel.In summary my two experiences couldn’t be more different. I don’t see myself moving away from the Intercontinental given it is very close by and excellent.

634407257,89575,60745,Wedding of our Dreams!,"Having stayed at the Boston Harbor Hotel previously, my husband and I were very excited to tour this location when searching for a Boston wedding venue. We knew from prior visits that the setting is beautiful, the service is top-notch, and the food is beyond compare. Upon deciding to book the BHH for our wedding, our high expectations for this venue were well surpassed! Our experience began with Michael Boivin, our wedding coordinator. Michael was with us from our first contact with the BHH through the wedding evening, even taking care to deliver my heirloom veil safely to our room. This small detail exemplifies the service at the BHH. Michael is well known throughout the Boston wedding industry as the best in the business! On top of everything he coordinated within the BHH, he was able to put us in contact with high-quality vendors for services including flowers, lighting, etc., which was immeasurably helpful. From the second you pull up to the hotel until the moment you leave, you are greeted by the friendly faces of employees who want you to have an amazing experience. Michael Boivin, Jennifer Lammers, Laura Furfaro, and everyone we worked with consistently went above and beyond to make our dream day a reality.The setting of the Boston Harbor Hotel is a truly unique one. The backdrop of the harbor is beautiful, and our guests enjoyed watching planes, boats, sunrises and passers-by throughout their stay at the hotel.  The central location makes it easy to visit other Boston attractions, catch a game at the Garden, or eat at one of Boston’s famed restaurants.For a fantastic meal, however, you need go no further than the BHH itself. We wanted our wedding guests to have a delicious meal at our wedding. Months later, we are still hearing from friends and family that this was not only the best wedding meal they have eaten, but one of the best meals they've ever had in general!  The wedding menus are filled with so many mouth-watering options that it was difficult to choose just a few for our menu!  We were pleased to find flexibility in the menu options as well – unlike other venues we had toured. From the service to the ambiance to the food, we could not be happier with our choice to host our wedding at the Boston Harbor Hotel. The motto of the BHH is “Beyond Compare,” and throughout our wedding process – from initially reaching out to Michael, until we checked out as newlyweds – our dreams for a perfect experience were exceeded. We are so grateful to everyone who helped us throughout the process, and are looking forward to visiting again soon!",0,"November 19, 2018", December 2017,50,NA,NA,50,NA,50,NA,50,UID_C653C525813947B9985EC95875B4E320-SRC_634407257,"South Windsor, Connecticut",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KAndJurg,3,1,"70 Rowes Wharf, Boston, MA 02110-3354"

664889159,89575,60745,No excuses for check in disaster,"I booked through American Express platinum because the location met our needs, we have been here before and we expected 5 star excellence.A good hotel experience begins with check in and this was the worst experience I have ever had. I travel all over the world most of the time so I was shocked by the whole situation. I flew in from Palm Beach and took the boat from the airport. This took an hour and a half because I must have missed the connecting bus and no one at the airport knows where it is. My first mistake because a cab takes about 6 minutes. I arrived at the hotel where my husband who had flown in from New York had been waiting for two hours in the lobby  because reception would not check him in since it was booked on my credit card. WHAT?! When I questioned the front desk they said it was for my security and a policy of the hotel WHAT?! I was also told I had obviously not read the fine print on the reservation. WHAT? ARE YOU KIDDING?! If this hotel is owned by JP Morgan ( it’s in the same building) I suggest Jamie Dimon go on undercover boss and sees what happens here. I have never ever had an experience like this. I was so furious and exhausted I called AmEx and told them to handle it. We were given an upgrade to a room with one out of four or five windows facing the harbor. The room was clean, the bed was comfortable, the bathroom was fine. I really loved the gulls that perched on our windowsill.We ordered room service breakfast. The kitchen must be really far away. My egg white omelet was beautiful to look at and covered in oil. The bread and English muffin my husband ordered were stone cold. I had to go to a meeting so I went. My husband called to complain and room service said they would take the breakfast off the bill. Did I tell you the room came with breakfast? When we checked out the remainder was still on the bill. I don’t think there is any communication here.I want to compliment the concierge and the Sea Grill. The people working in both places were completely professional, welcoming and excellent at their jobs.The managers of the grill ( day and night) do an excellent job. Susan, our waitress, kept checking to make sure we were happy. Just for the record , my husband asked if he were famous or the Sultan of Brunei would they have checked him in and the front desk said YES!!!! WHAT?!!! My husband is in finance and he tends to scream when furious. I was totally shocked that he didn’t scream or call AmEx. Thank so much for ruining my stay. Half of my family is from Boston . Are they famous- some are, are they well known -some very well known especially in the business world. Should it matter. Absolutely not. My dollar is as good as anyone’s but perhaps this hotel has had serious guest or security problems.Oh I noticed at turn down not only was the bed not turned down but no chocolate , no fruit bowl, no nothing except water( thank you I really need water. ) I thought I was being too critical when we heard the man in the next room ask why no chocolate? Well at least that provided a good laugh.I told friends and family what happened. They were shocked. Everyone loves the Sea Grill. Next time I’ll get my friends the seagulls to recommend a hotel.This is an expensive , 5 star hotel in a beautiful setting and a wonderful location .The way it is operating it does not deserve more than 4 stars.Even American Express couldn’t believe it!",0,"April 8, 2019", April 2019,40, Traveled as a couple,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,UID_5EAFE57D7927312CCB880977045D63B2-SRC_664889159,NYC,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NCR_12,594,168,"70 Rowes Wharf, Boston, MA 02110-3354"

69542298,89575,60745,A View to Remember,"This is a hotel that knows how to welcome and take care of its guests.  The staff was friendly, attentive and helpful throughout our stay.  We had a room with a harbor view and it was simply spectacular -- sitting in the room was its own tourist attraction.  The room itself was spacious and well appointed, and had the usual niceties such as robe, slippers, upscale bedding, etc. Another nice touch: free internet access (think of how many hotels in this price range take the occasion to ding you another $10-15 for internet service). The health club and large pool were also first-rate and, again, the staff really made a difference.  Location was good for walking around, and Boston has to be one of the best cities in the USA for walking.  Another extra -- at least until mid-September -- is the free outdoor entertainment dockside in the evenings.  I am generally wary of hotel restaurants, but the Rowes Wharf Sea Grille was certainly an exception to my rule.  The food was delicious.  Also -- if you have a few extra minutes (and luggage you can easily schlep), take the water taxi ($10) to Logan airport from the hotel.  Hotel to terminal check-in line took us 45 minutes, and that included a detour to pick up another passenger at a wharf about 10 minutes away.

From the moment you arrive you are greeted like you are king and queen! Everyone at the hotel was so friendly and helpful. I was born and raised in R.I. so I am not a stranger to Boston, but after being away for so many years (43), we decided to be complete ""tourists"" and did ALL of Boston including - North End, Chinatown, Back Bay, Beacon Hill, Financial District, Waterfront - and even walked the whole Freedom Trail. In four days we walked 31 miles, even walking to the U.S. Constitution and up the 294 steps of the Bunker Hill Monument., Boston is a great walkiing city and so easy to get around, especially with the T which took us to Harvard. The there is the Harbor Cruise we took (90 minutes) to the outer islands and around the bay.Back to the hotel, we are light sleepers and NEVER heard a sound in our room. A big plus. Room was nice, not much different in size from any other nice hotel (smallish bathroom) and decorating was very pleasing. The room was always spotless.There are so many awesome restaurants in Boston that we chose not to eat at the hotel but we did spend our first night eating a small meal outside on the dock while listeniing to their blues band play. I had the Ipswich clams and they were a bit off. Only ate 1/4 of them. Waiter didn't seem to care. Only other thing we didn't like was in their bar which is inside the restaurant. The head bartender was full of himself and even berated and chastised two of the waiters right in front of us. (Only 6 stools at the bar.) I had to ask for water three times before I finally got some from a different bartender. It was about 5:00pm and three bartenders were setting up the bar and taking inventory They were constantly talking to each other and never tried to be friendly with anyone at the bar. It was like we were in the way. Being such a small bar, it was very distracting and not relaxing at all, so we left to find a quieter place to sit. Apart from that one incident, the stay was perfect. Oh, and the health club was awesome. The hot tub was almost as big as a small livingroom! My husband would go down every morning to get his workout in and they had a room set up with coffee, juice, TV, etc. So at least he could bring coffee up to the room without using room service. The spa was immaculate, including the locker room, which was huge. The pool was Olympic size.Perfect location to walk to Quincey Market for a bite to eat and close to the North End where we ate at Giacomo's for dinner. Long wait but worth it. Lots of fun.Ate great steamers at Rusty Dog at Quincey Market and had a wonderful lobster roll at the restaurant at the Marriott  Long Wharf, the way a lobster roll should be (chunks of lobster, a bit of mayo and a bit of celery stuffed inside a hot dog bun that is toasted).

78614075,89575,60745,Maybe I should've gone with Intercontinental?,"My Fiancé and I spent our Labor day weekend here at Boston Harbor Hotel.  The hotel grounds and exterior are grand and gorgeous.  The inside is rather small but still nice enough for a super expensive hotel.  Its nothing like the Willard in D.C.  No crazy chandeliers, ornate ceilings, or huge vases of flowers that get changed out daily.  The hotel itself is ""older"".  There are certain areas that could use an update and maybe a good cleaning.  We got a deluxe superior room facing the harbor.  My mouth dropped as soon as we walked in the door.  The view was incredible.  Definitely a million dollar view.  The room itself was very large with a nice living area, a dressing area and bathroom.  It was clean but had a weird muggy odor. The spa and gym area were very nice-huge!!  the bottom of the pool and spa seemed a bit dirty- a nice cleaning would do the trick.  The shower in the Locker rooms were fantastic! Far different from the room shower.  The room shower was a total trick and definitely disappointing.  It literally trickled... and it was so close to the front of the shower, I wondered how larger people shower comfortably in there.As far as the service goes, it was hit or miss. My conception is that for a five star hotel at the prices that we were paying, the service should be top notch.  Plus, with all the positive reviews on yelp and trip advisor, I was expecting some pretty spectacular service.  Not normal hotel or even below service.  The front desk and concierge were part of the good but it seemed like everyone else missed the good service bus and took a mental vacation from working in the hospitality industry.  The door was never opened for us on the first day.  It would have been nice for the door man to greet us as we walked in.  We had to hail our own cab.  Not a big deal, it was right in front of the hotel.  The lady working in the locker room was rude or maybe she was just confused?  Whichever the case, I was having trouble using the locker lock and instead of explaining to me how to use it- nicely- she pretty much gave me  towel and rushed out without explaining.  I found out from another guest how to use the lockers.  I must say that day two was much better than the day we checked in.  It made us think, how come we didn't get service like this the day before?  This review is based on what we paid and the service we received.  If the place wasn't so darn expensive, I probably wouldn't have given Boston Harbor Hotel such a mediocre review. The view was spectacular but there are other hotels on the waterfront that are three times less expensive with comparable service.  In the future, I'll be staying at one of those.  I'll miss the view but probably nothing else.",0,"September 7, 2010", August 2010,20,NA,40,20,40,50,40,30,UID_611A2AACA2267A12D25AFF59523DBC04-SRC_78614075,Columbia Maryland,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoveLife82,17,48,"70 Rowes Wharf, Boston, MA 02110-3354"
79372842,89575,60745,"I will NEVER go back-EVER, not even for a FREE stay. Terrible.","I originally booked my stay for 4 days but only stayed one night because my friends and family that were in town were all at the W Hotel (which is fabulous). They reserved $2600 for the four nights and I checked out at $600. The front desk lady told me to call American Express to let them know of the change, which I did. They told me to have the hotel  contact them to tell them the total so they can release the other holds. Sounds simple enough, so I relayed the message and they told me they would take care of it and not to worry.I called to follow up the issue and turns out that no one ever called American Express. I called the Boston Harbor Hotel and asked them to call. Not only did they call this time, but charged me an extra $600. Really? So I called American Express and they told me that the hotel did NOT take the charges off, but yet charged a second time. I call the hotel AGAIN and spoke to the same person I spoke with before. He did not listen and tried to cut me off when I explained the situation, which is VERY frustrating especially when HE is the one who messed up. So he says, ""I'll fix it first thing in the morning""...Guess what?American Express told me that he tried to charge $649.90 AGAIN!!!!???What the %$#*& is wrong with them??So know my available credit is $3800 less because of all their unecessary charges. I am still planning on traveling for the next 4 days in  a different city so I need all of my available credit just in case. I cannot afford to wait 7-10 business days for them to get their heads out of their butts to finally solve the problem they created for me. So I speak to another person who is obviously getting annoyed with me when I explain the situation...which I'm sure you can understand how I felt. So I had to give him specific instructions to call them, what to say, then to call me back because I obviously cannot trust that they will do this on their own. So he calls me back and said that they reversed the other charges but gave me a total of $649.00 which is incorrect. Then after looking through he said that they only submitted a charge for $600. Whew. I know if you're still reading you must be SO confused, and I understand how it can be confusing but they handled the situation terribly. The manager barely apologized and when I got off the phone, I realized that they are not gracious to their guests. I spent 3 days out of my vacation making numerous phone calls and taking to poorly trained individuals who made the situation worse. COMPLETELY frustrating. Save yourself some frustration and stay somewhere else. It's not really THAT nice of a hotel...I would describe it as ""Grandma Fancy""...I was not impressed.

8028995,89575,60745,Beautiful View!!,"The only thing I can say that we really hated, was we did not get to spend another few days in this hotel!  We got to the Boston Harbor Hotel, and upon check in, we were told we were being upgraded to a room with a sitting area.  We had booked a room with a harbor view, and what a pleasant surprise to learn the hotel was going to upgrade our room, without us even asking.    When we got into the room, I think we were left speechless for the first time in our lives.  The view of the Harbor from the 9th floor was incredible!  If we thought the room was to die for, then we should not have been surprised to find the staff the same way.  From the time the valet parked our car, to the check out the next day, the staff made us feel like royalty!  We have never been to Boston, or any of the East Coast before,  so it can be somewhat daunting to find your way around, and decide what and where you want to go.  The Bellman first put our bags up, and then spent a good amount of time helping us get aquainted with the city.  The concierge was also a huge help to us, and gave us some good advice on where to go when you have a limited time to be in Boston.  I read every travel book I could get my hands on before we got to Boston, and I swear this concierge could have written his own book!    The concierge staff at this hotel work 24 hours, literally.  Since we arrived late in the day, we were tired, so we had room service delivered.  They set up a table right next to the window overlooking the Boston Harbor, and all the lights.  I do not think I have ever had a more romantic hamburger in my life!  The room service was prompt, and the food was still hot.  My husband and I were trying to get in as much as we could of Boston, and we were really pushing for time the day we had to leave.  We were running late from sighseeing, and were coming up to the door of the hotel, telling the staff we had to be at the airport A.S.A.P.!  The whole staff went into action to get us to the airport on time.  The valet got our car quickly, and seeing how winded we were from running around, offered us bottled water for the road.  The Concierge printed out directions to the airport, and the front desk checked us out at warp speed.  We got to the airport in time, thanks to the hotels efficiency.  The only things about this hotel that we were not crazy about, was getting to the hotel.  It is difficult to get to, because of all the construction going on, but the hotel cannot help that.  There was no noise in the room because of the construction.  The other thing I thought could have been better, was that the bathroom did not match the elegance of the rest of the room.  It was quite plain, with a regular white shower/tub.  WIth these kind of rooms, service, and price, I really expected the bathrooms to be as luxurious as the rest of the hotel.

It's the public who let the doord slam, not the Hotel.We intended to try a different place to eat each night, but such was the quality and ambience of the public rooms and restaurants at the Boston Harbor we only ventured further afield on 2 nights of our 7 night stay.I have travelled the world on businsess and pleasure by I have never experienced the level of professionalism, knowledge and courtesy offered the Concierge team.

8716998,89575,60745,"Nice Hotel, Great Location","A number of business colleagues and I stayed at the Boston Harbor during a conference.  I hadn't stayed there in probably 10 years.  My opinion then was that it was over rated.  What a difference 10 y ears makes.I arrived from a red eye flight to find my room ready and waiting.  The room was huge, with a decent work space, plenty of sitting space, flat screen TV, BOSE wave radio, and a comfy room.  And a great water view.  I was on a smoking floor but could smell no smoke.The staff is polite, friendly, and helpful.  I showed up early in our meeting room and found no coffee.  When I mentioned to a co-worker that I was doing OK for a guy who slept on a plane the staff person who was setting up our room offered to go find me some coffee, and showed up with a full pot.  Location is great.  Right on the harbor, walking distance to downtown, and on a great running route.The only issue I had was minor - the air conditioner was shut off when I arrived, meaning my room was about 75.  I turned it on and left, only to return at the end of the day to find it off again.  I later learned it's on an automatic shut off.  As a result I was always too hot.

8838852,89575,60745,Great hotel...we loved it and will go back,"The hotel was absolutely a delight, and the room (804), overlooking the harbor, in a perfect location.  If there is a negative about the hotel, it is the very noisy doors.  I booked months in advance and asked for the most quiet room possible since I have a sleep disorder.  Our room was in the center hallway, by no means the most private area.  Desk staff did attempt to reassign us the second day, but the rooms (2 we looked at) had obstructed views.  The decision was made to put up with the noise from the banging doors which didn't prove to be a major problem.  The first day of our stay, several children were in the room next door and in/out every few minutes, but the next day our neighbors were more considerate.  There is a definite noise issue with the bang after each door closes, even if you try to pull it shut as gently as possible. I was told that the hotel is working on that problem.  It would not stop me from staying there again, but certainly a consideration when booking.The location is perfect in our opinion.  We had dinner out two evenings at the hotel restaurant while we enjoyed performances on the Blues Barge.  This is seasonal entertainment and we were there with perfect weather (August 25-30).  Staff was attentive and helpful.  Our room, with a separate sitting area, was spotless.  Free water and fruit each day.  Well worth the extra expense for a harbor view.We were celebrating a very special anniversary and I was surprised that it was not mentioned by staff, etc.  We didn't expect anything, but every year we visit a city to celebrate our anniversary and some hotels are very thoughtful about a special day.  As a tip, I found that by booking directly via the hotel's website, I got a much better price than I could get from anywhere else.  Several times, the cost fluctuated and by cancelling and immediately rebooking at the cheaper rate I saved $150 each night on our room.   Takes time, but certainly a nice savings.",0,"September 20, 2007", August 2007,50,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,UID_D5A30475C62B00634F13CEA3E1D4FF19-SRC_8838852,"chester, il",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/symmie,2,7,"70 Rowes Wharf, Boston, MA 02110-3354"

99452253,89575,60745,The Best Service in all of Boston,"After some mixed luck with some of the Boutique hotels in Boston I opted for something that was five star and had review which raved about service rather then a gitchy lobby or iPod docks in the rooms. The old expression goes that ""you get what you pay for"" and in the case of the Boston Harbor I paid a bit more then those Back Bay Boutiques and received service from the staff which was ten fold that of the price difference between the hotels. The greeting at the door was excellent and friendly; The doormen know the city and were a very valuable resource during my stay in Boston. The lobby itself has a typical five star hotel charm to it; an attempt to look old world which offers a traditional classic type of charm. The check in process was excellent; my room was already assigned my requests were filled and I had a wonderful dinner recommendation and directions within a few moments. Its rare that in today's day and age you actually get a concierge who truly knows the ins and outs of a city without having to go to some pre-bookmarked website in order to give the guests a recommendation. I was asked what sort of dinner fare I was seeking, I made three general comments and was given three different restaurant suggestions off the top of his head with recommendations at each. Now THAT is a concierge. Note: The hotel bar has one of the most extensive scotch selections I have ever tried, not to be missed. The rooms themselves were very nicely done; they felt like they belonged in a high end hotel, however I am rarely a sucker for decor. The bed was wonderful, the TV was large, and the water pressure in the shower was great.
